Unconventional Diner;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/unconventional-diner-washington-3?not_recommended_start=0;Craig J.;1;6/27/2024;"Had Brussels sprouts and egg, naan, and some drinks at a place that calls itself ""all day brunch."" Surprisingly, they don't have an espresso machine. The naan turned out to be a thick, pre-made bread rather than actual naan bread. The ""tikka masala"" spice on the Brussels sprouts was more like a hot sauce and didn't resemble the original dish. It was served with a sunny-side-up egg and some pre-cut cabbage without any dressing. The food was below average, and it's surprising that we had to wait for a table.Disappointing.";Washington, DC;13;16;525;90;1;0

Unconventional Diner;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/unconventional-diner-washington-3?not_recommended_start=0;Marcia F.;1;5/15/2023;Please Read Entire PostTHE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. I just dined outside at Unconventional Diner with a friend. Mid meal a homeless person walked up from behind and me and took an entire piece of chicken off of my plate and spit it towards our direction. He proceeded to chew my food, then took my glass off my table and was acting crazy. No staff or manager was present during the entire ordeal, as several other patrons watched. The manager finally came out because my friend went inside to grab someone as they walked the man down the road. MANAGEMENT SHAME ON YOU. Nobody asked how I was doing after this occurred, and not a SINGLE manager came up to us after this episode. Instead our waiter told us the first order of food which was violated would be compliments of the house. They took nothing off the bill. This was a terrible situation, and horrible customer service. What if I was attacked? Afterwards I went up to management and told them how horrible of an experience this was. While the food was good, this was my worst experience ever at a place I was looking forward to going to. I feel bad for the other patrons and again am so disappointed by those working that night. You weren't even busy, and thoughtfulness goes a long way. GOOD RIDDANCE;Lyon Park, Arlington, VA;0;11;1278;234;0;0

Unconventional Diner;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/unconventional-diner-washington-3?not_recommended_start=0;Monique S.;2;8/31/2023;This place offers, hands down, one of the best brunch experiences with shrimp & grits that are absolutely delectable. I've visited four times and the culinary delight remains a constant, every single time.So, why the 3-star rating? Sadly, it's the customer service that hinders this establishment from becoming a top favorite. Despite the culinary brilliance, every visit comes with a hint of reluctance due to previous encounters with the staff.During my first visit in 2021, the overall experience was delightful, until it was time to leave. I had ordered a bottle of champagne, which I couldn't finish, and a staff member-- not my waitress--corked it for me. However, before I could even set the bottle down, the cork exploded, hitting my head and causing the champagne to spill. This mishap could have had severe consequences had it hit my eye or mouth.Upon reporting this to the manager, the response was less than considerate. After spending around $120 and leaving a 25% tip, not even a replacement bottle was offered as compensation. Having experience as a bartender, I'm aware that the retail price of the champagne is significantly lower than what is charged, and a comped bottle would have been a decent gesture for the inconvenience. I tried to give the benefit of the doubt, attributing this to possibly inadequate training during COVID times.Despite this experience, I returned with a friend, hoping for a better experience. Unfortunately, we faced another corking issue, and it led to a heated exchange between my friend and another manager. It seems the issues are predominantly with the management.The food here is undeniably exquisite, but there's a pressing need for better staff training, especially when it comes to corking bottles, and a shift in attitude towards patrons. It's frustrating to face such issues when we, as customers, are well aware of rules and standards.;Washington, DC;67;96;1893;308;1;161

The fries weren't my favorite, just average. The corned beef hash had too much meat for my liking. On the bright side, the blueberry lavender pancakes were really good - they were light, fluffy, and not overly sweet. Sadly, I didn't get to taste any of the mascarpone as my daughter ate it all!

Unconventional Diner;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/unconventional-diner-washington-3?not_recommended_start=10;Olivia B.;3;07/07/2019;I'd heard rave reviews but was unimpressed in person. I enjoyed my cocktail- the sunshine of your love- and did like reading the creative cocktail list and menu but everything else was a solid 'fine.'It was a hot day so I decided I didn't want anything too heavy and went with the dirty Cesar salad. The roasted tomatoes it claimed to come with was just a scoop of bad salsa. The dish was colorful with a nicely cooked soft boiled egg and black crouton dust atop the greens but the overall taste was not good and I had to force myself through it.We also tried the pot pie poppers which they were known for were- and honestly I don't understand why. Bland and unimpressive.The waitress encouraged us to try dessert because their pastry chef had just won pastry chef of the year but none of the items appealed to us. The space was modern and clean. The bench I sat in was too low for the table though which made things slightly uncomfortable- a silly detail but one that should have been addressed given the level of sophistication they are trying to present with.;Dacula, GA;0;8;1062;194;1;57

In this case the staff were super friendly and welcoming etc.Great food for me is 4 star though and only becomes 5 when again there is something unusual or unique and extraordinary about it. My baked Brie was close to that. The Peking duck though very nice was only what I expected, maybe a bit too salty when you don't eat the buns to offset that.;Downtown, Washington, DC;31;5;447;82;1;5

Unconventional Diner;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/unconventional-diner-washington-3?not_recommended_start=20;Katie V.;4;08/03/2023;Came for brunch on a Saturday around noon and it was super busy! We got reservations and it was definitely the move! Many people got turned away while we were waiting for our table since they are so packed. The interior is so pretty!! It's split up into 3 different sections: front area/open kitchen, bar with seating and second dining area (pink room). Plenty of seating which was nice and the ambiance was lively but not too loud. The food was better than I expected! I got the poutine and it was super flavorful and nicely savory, not overly salty. There was a good amount of meat to fries ratio and plentiful gravy on top. The egg was cooked just right and the yolk mixed in was super good. The Georgia French toast was decent! It wasn't anything special but a good choice if you like peach cobbler! The chicken and waffles was so good! The chicken was nice and crispy and the waffle had so much savoriness to it. The butter and sauces wasn't overly spicy either (even tho it said habanero). The pancakes are so picturesque. I'm not a huge fan of pancakes but my friend really liked them! They give you a lot for one order. Fries were standard and crispy and the sexy sauce was like a ketchup Mayo burger sauce. Standard but in a good way! Ratings: French dip poutine: 8/10Georgia French Toast: 8/10Pancake: 9/10 Chicken and waffles: 8/10 Fries: 9/10 Drinks: 10/10 (strong) Overall, I'd totally come back. BE AWARE they do an automatic 20% gratuity. This was a bit annoying bc our waiter def was lacking... all the staff seemed kind of whatever since the tip was already included. If I went back I'd totally just go to the bar! The bartender was super nice and much better than our waiter.

This place is located under the Washington Convention center, it is a bit out of the way from the main road. The menu is very innovative, fresh,different and interesting. We ordered pop pie popper as appetizer, it was ok. The main dish of crab linguine is out of this world, the Wagyu double cheeseburger is also excellently prepared.

I highly recommend starting with the cornbread skillet with honey butter--it was absolutely delicious. Another standout side was the macaroni and cheese, which, as someone very particular about this dish, I found to be one of the best in the city. The moroccan taquitos were also a tasty choice. For my main course, I kept it simple and chose the double cheese burger and fries. It was surprisingly good and left me wanting more. To top it off, I had the basque cheesecake and it was incredibly good. I loved every bite. OverallUnconventional Diner is a fantastic place for both food and drinks.

It is located on 9th St NW between M St NW and N St NW. For those who can walk... It is walking distance from the Walter E Washington Convention Center. I am unsure about the parking situation since I do not recall if you can park on the street, however, I am sure there are parking garages you can park at. + EV CHARGING: EV Charging is offered with fees in some of the local parking garages near the establishment.

Yes, food is unconventional but exceeded expectations.Ordered the following Taquitos - light delicious and crispy with sauce to die for Cornbread - I hate carbs usually and it was just so moist and the habanero butter was the icing on the cake, just luscious Fried chicken - smaack yo mama good, the skin was unbelievably crispy and flavorful, didn't care for the hot sauce but the cole slaw was light and not mayoo based. Gravy was delicious and went marvelously with the mashed potatoes.Meatloaf -- totally unreal and has biTs of cheese inside. Outside sauce was very good. Just a loaf of meat that was moist and flavorful. Dessert - mocha cappuccino dessert (brownie, cofffee cream and ice cream) I mean it was so clever and stunning and the textural elements added bY the chOOcolaTe malt balls was just so lovely and made the dessert epic for me .Overall pleasantly surprised as I'm a pretty critical personn. The only feeedback that I i would change is the ice cubes. The cocktails were so good and the cubed crushed ice made the drink watered down and hard to drink.

Unconventional Diner;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/unconventional-diner-washington-3?not_recommended_start=140;Dino P.;5;05/10/2018;On Wednesday 5.9.18 I brought a friend visiting from out of town. We were immediately greeted and seated by two friendly hosts. The space is beautiful, clean, and full of energy (even half full). We ordered the special gazpacho which was outstanding. We also ordered the fish sticks and the pot pie bites since they seem to be a favorite amongst reviewers. The pot pie bites were different than most of the pictures missing the yellow topping and plated differently as well. They were good but not memorable. The fish sticks however were incredible! The saffron aioli that accompanies is so delicious. For entrees we ordered the steak and eggs and the chicken parm. Both executed perfectly. While the steak and eggs was excellent it was steak and eggs. We couldn't stop eating the unique and very rich chicken parm. So much so I'm waiting for Postmates to deliver it to me again right now one day later. We wrapped up with the coconut cream pie which is absolutely the best coconut cream pie I've ever had. The best part of the entire experience was the service. If you are lucky enough to have Jasmine, you will become a regular. While the DC restaurant scene has been blowing up over the years and offering some incredible places to dine, good service is very hard to find in DC. Jasmine knew exactly when to check in to ensure we always had everything we needed. Offered great advice on dishes and was just so incredibly sweet. She is a true gem and a perfect fit in such a refreshingly new addition to the DC dining scene. It did not stop there. My friend and I observed other staff engaging with their guests and all around happy. I tried to catch the GM Donna on the way out to personally thank her and congratulate her on such an amazing team but she was busy keeping the flow and engaging with customers.

Let's just say the company was really the only part of the experience I enjoyed. Food was hilariously overpriced for the blandness and mediocrity that we received. Mac and Cheese tasted like nothing. The sweet potato mash tasted like I was eating a candle. We audibly laughed when we saw the bill was $100. The only good thing about our meal was the grilled cheese but let's be real - that is pretty hard to mess up. Service was good. Our waiter told us he wanted us to have a nice long night, which I appreciated. The icing on the cake was when my friend came back from the bathroom horrified that the restroom was covered in urine and feces. Crappy way to end the night to be honest.

The main dishes served were merely average, not living up to the restaurant's highly rated reputation. However, the real disappointment came with the dessert course. The ice cream, which should have been a refreshing treat, was disappointingly melted. More distressingly, the double chocolate cake, which should have been a sweet and satisfying ending to the meal, left me feeling sick and resulted in an unfortunate episode of vomiting. In an industry that thrives on culinary excellence and customer satisfaction, Founding Farmers fell short on my visit, transforming what should have been an enjoyable dining experience into an unpleasant ordeal.;San Diego, CA;0;140;773;116;0;203

Our experience was a disaster and our food came out 9 minutes after ordering it. So of course it was sitting in a window already prepared, but then you take a bite and it's ice cold. Server was nowhere to be found to tell about the issue. Chicken fingers were ice cold in temperature but burning hot with spice (definitely not as listed on the menu) and an empty water jug on our table didn't help cool my mouth. Beignets had a tiny sprinkle of powdered sugar but were still raw, doughy, and undercooked on the inside! On top of 15 other issues, on my way out I was having a conversation about Founding Farmers not offering a kids menus. The host stopped us and said they don't have a kids menu but they have a ""smaller size"" option the server can ring in for kids. I said well, we asked our server for a kids menu and she said they didn't have one and made no mention of any other options. The host then said ""well, ya they don't really tell anyone cause they want you to spend money on the full size entrees"". Never again will I patronize a restaurant that allows their employees to conduct themselves in this manner. Food was bad, service was bad, and obviously the restaurant's ""values/morals"" are bad or badly enforced.";Villanova, PA;4;4;1425;268;0;0

When we got there we had to wait 30 minutes to sit down. When we finally sat down the waiter kept forgetting that 5 people were at the table and kept bringing 4 glasses or 4 rollups. I ordered a soda as my drink and they brought out a glass of ice. They said the soda comes after the glass but my glass.WAS.DIRTY!!!!! Then they bring us cans of soda to pour into the glass. Then we wait about 30 more minutes for our food and all the notes we have the waiter about our food we ignored. Like we asked for the mini cheeseburgers without cheese and they still put cheese on it. I didn't like my food and my fork was dirty. I would not go here again.;Bowie, MD;0;14;723;145;1;4

I reported a 2 year old Kenmore Elite washer making noises. Took a week for a repairman to come out. Took it apart..said it was fixed.. you can now use it!...he lef...t WRONG! He was no sooner out of the driveway when all heck broke loose! Washer was in worse shape than before! Immediately called Repair number. Told repairman would call right back...never did! Recalled that evening..told the same thing...never called. I recalled and asked for a Supervisor..no Supervisors on the floor. ""I will have one call you right back"" Never did..Called the next morning turns out all the calls about washer being left worse that before were never logged! So I had to make another call and schedule another appointment a week later. Same repairman comes out..determines he cant fix it..orders a slew of parts! Must wait another week BUT we can still use it!!! Repairman is gone 15 minutes and washer quits and lid is permanetly locked sgut. Can't get wet clothes out! Called Repair..got the runaround again for 5 hours. Called and email Sears Customer Care in Hoffman Estates IL. Wait a bunch of idiots! Nothing they can do at all!

I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie and the Mushroom Risotto. I ask before i order this (Because i have never had it.) does the Pot pie travel well? Because i have to take this to work and if it does not then i do not want to order it. The gentleman who was nice enough with the huge red beard tells me it should and that it should not be a problem.The first issue i notice is that there are gnats flying about this establishment which is a bad sign but i assume that they came in through the front door and it was a busy night. The second thing i notice is that the bar area smells a little. ( I say this and i know that they have plates and such from patrons that eat at the bar. But the smell was noticeable and i should have left but was short on time to go anywhere else.)I wait thirty five minutes for my order (which is not a problem if the food is going to be good.) I walk the two blocks to my job and sit and do my little bit of work. (about 30 minutes passes before i look at my food) I pull out medicine that i have to take with food with no other means of eating for the night. I look in the Chicken pot pie box and there is this huge biscuit surrounded by the pot pie filling. The whole thing looks extremely unappetizing. The biscuit is hard stale and dense. The pot pie filling is at a guess to describe is that it tasted like an old fridge. I move on to the risotto and it is rancid. There is no other way to describe it but rancid. I paid 23 dollars for this meal and left a five dollar tip. I threw this food in the trash. Not to mention the fact that the two bites of risotto and the three bites of pot pie have me sick as a dog as i type this and i am not able to take my medicine because i have no food. 1.) Founding Farmers i would like my money back. 2.) I will be telling everyone i work with about this experience. 3. ) I will NEVER eat at this location again and to say that if i ever have a bad experience at the different locations i am done with founding farmers.;Alexandria, VA;37;5;2029;418;1;0

My girlfriend and I decided to visit founding farmers after hearing many great things and how great the food is. Upon entering the hostess stand was very rude to us and told us it would be a 45 minute wait or we could sit at the bar. We wanted a table so we chose to wait. We waited and waited and watched as people who came in the door after us were given a table before us. When I inquired to the hostess she just said that when our table was ready our name would be called like she didn't care at all we had to wait all this time. When we were finally seated we were seated in a cramped location. The waiter was a spanish guy with a thick accent and he gave us the worst service ever. It was so obvious he didn't want to wait on us!! I asked what he recommended and he just said everythings good pick something you like. I ordered the gingerale which was way too spicy for me and when I told him I couldn't drink it he rudely snatched the glass off the table and said oh so you just want this taken off your check? And he stormed off. He didn't even offer us dessert at the end he just asked us if we wanted split checks when we were done eating. We had to ask to see the dessert menu. No politeness no smile nothing. Me and my friend couldn't believe how we were being treated. For food I ordered the rotisserie chicken with the sweet which was delicious. My friend ordered the butternut ravioli which she said she liked. We shared a carrot cske for dessert. The food here is good at least. Overall I might come back because I liked the food but would hope to be treated a little better by the staff next time.;Washington, DC;0;3;1713;339;1;0
Founding Farmers - Washington;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/founding-farmers-washington-washington-3?not_recommended_start=70;Mitt R.;1;11/23/2012;"I thought I would give FoundIng Farmers one more try for Thanksgiving. With a set menu I assumed it would be impossible for them to ruin the meal.I was wrong. While our waitress was great, in terms of attitude, she clearly missed the mark, as did the entire serving team. If anyone is managing the restaurant they need to spend some time training all of the wait staff. The food was equally problematic. I hoped that with a set menu they would produce their best food. I assume the bus boys were cooking.Our waitress was so rushed she didn't even tell us about Founding Farmers, and what they were all about. After dropping menus I immediately ordered a cocktail, which threw her off. It is a usually wonderful mix of Knob Creek, a touch of Tabasco, and a garnish of bacon. It really is good if made correctly, whoever made it seemed to poor in Tabasco and add a touch of bourbon. I couldn't taste my bread when it came. I have never had to send a drink back in my life.I couldn't get over why they didn't give us bread, as in a basket, instead of one piece per person. The bread is pretty average, so I don't know why they aren't generous with it. Especially considering what we paid for out meal.The soup arrived immediately after the bread hit the table, and before we had ordered wine. The soup was a very odd mix of flavors. I imagine if properly done, it would have been good, unfortunately it was not edible.While we were in the middle of soup, the main courses arrived. A trained server would have taken it back and kept it warm, instead I actually ended up holding my soup while the server dropped the plates on the table. I thought the Entree was overkill. There was no need for six sides and a tiny bit of cranberry sauce. Why not serve two sides, and put some effort into them. Did I mention the food was cold when it came. For the prices they charge they could work on some quality control.Amazingly, while our server kept coming by with a smile and ""how is everything"", she never asked us if we wanted more wine. Our glasses were empty 15 minutes into the meal. I can't understand why they wouldn't offer to refill them, except out of laziness. Also, when my water glass was 3/4 empty a server picked it up and carried it away. No, they didn't refill it, they carried it away. I had to ask for another glass.Dessert was interesting. The cheesecake was delicious, it always is, but it had obviously been sitting out all day and was almost runny. If the waitress had come back I would have sent it back.The coffee course was also very interesting. We were not offered coffee or tea. I still don't believe this. I have never had dinner when I was not offered coffee or tea in any restaurant in the United States.It was obvious they were desperate to get us out of the table as quickly as possible. I feel bad for them. They spent so much on their concept, but can't get the food and service correct. This has been a problem on multiple visits. Rushing us out was the final straw. They managed to rush us out and clear the table for another party, but until they get their act together, I see no reason to return for bad food and bad service.";Washington, DC;0;39;3188;589;0;3

Terrible as in god awful. Our waiter was a very brash australian man who acted as though it was an annoyance to wait on us. Whenever we made a request, he would give us a look as though we weren't worth his time. Such arrogance! Our group of four spent a pretty penny and you would think when you spend that kind of money, you get good service. That wasn't the case here. I'll point out the blunders:-He took 20 minutes to get us our drinks and got one of our drinks wrong. When we pointed this out to him, he arrogantly said ""no that's the right one."" We asked another waiter for a menu, and sure enough, it was incorrect. And wouldn't you know - the wrong drink showed up on our bill. -He never bothered to clear our table. When we were eating dessert, we still had some plates from our appetizer and main course round on the table. -He didn't box up our food but instead brought us the boxes. I don't mind boxing up our food, but when I see waiters at other tables boxing up the patron's food and we're spending over $50 per person, it would have been a nice touch. Also, when he dropped off the boxes, he sort of ""threw"" them in the middle of the table without making eye contact and walked off. That rudeness was uncalled for!-He didn't even offer us dessert! We had to ask to see the menu. -He was rude, brash and inconsiderate. We usually leave a good tip but with service like this, we definitely did not. This is a shame to me because I saw waiters at other tables that looked friendly and helpful. So maybe we just had bad luck and its possible to receive good service if you get a different waiter. But likely, we won't return and take a chance finding out.";Arlington, VA;0;3;1694;324;1;0

I heard good things about Founding Farmers so my husband decided to make a reservation to check it out. We arrived for dinner and upon walking in the restaurant, we noticed it was hotter inside the building than outside. By the time we were seated, I was dying of thirst and my husband had sweat dripping down his face. The friendly waitress brought over some water and claimed she didn't know why the restaurant was so hot. Was the air conditioning broken?? Or are they too cheap to turn it up on a hot summer day?? Or is this a scam they are running to sell expensive drinks??? My husband and I drank at least six of those jars of water they bring to the table. We noticed patrons at other tables were experiencing the same discomfort. We skipped appetizers and we skipped desserts. We dont even remember how our entrees tasted because we couldn't wait to get out of there. There has to be some sort of a health code violation out there for this sort of thing. I feel like if I stayed any longer I would have become sick from the heat. Horrible experience and I won't be coming back.;Washington, DC;0;1;1241;235;0;0

I asked if I could have a drink and the smirky reply was ""Completely not. I thought you knew some one here."" So apparently they were closed, but instead of just saying that to begin with the guy had to make a joke out of it in front of his friends at our expense.Tip: If you're closed then lock the door.

Really dissappointing. the sales pitch from the servers was long and sounded recorded - I guess they have to keep saying over and over again to brainwash their customer! also, the bartender lied to us the night we were there. my friend ordered a 'constitution' - the bartender made him a 'blackberry julip'. we asked if this was the right drink - he said yes. guess he was banking on us not knowing the difference between a blackberry and a blueberry. well, if you lie about the farm freshness of the food - then I guess it isn't a far stretch!food was not great. drinks took over 30 minutes to get to our table - even though we told the server that we had a theatre time that night. we were paying check, choking our food down and running out the door. also, what the heck with the 'flatbreads'. we pictured a warm, thin crusted flatbread with the toppings listed - instead we got cold bread with cheese on top - why not just change the name? The potpie I ordered was just so not what I was hoping for. really heavy, doughy topping - sure wasn't how 'mama' used to make! Mussels were o.k. - but, the rest of our food just was dumped on the table. Nothing came when it was supposed to. The drinks arrived way after the starters.

The service was painfully slow, and the staff seemed overwhelmed.To make matters worse, we were seated at our table only to have a large family seated right next to us shortly after. You'd think they'd prioritize the guests who arrived first, but nope! The family received their food and drinks before us, despite arriving after us.The food itself was a letdown. Overpriced and underseasoned, the fried chicken dish was a disappointment. The green beans, ironically, had more flavor than the main event. The drinks, however, were the redeeming quality of our meal.Overall, I'd say Founding Farmers - Washington needs to revisit their service strategy and rework their menu pricing. Until then, I'd recommend exploring other options in the area.;High Point, NC;11;47;842;133;1;45

Founding Farmers - Washington;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/founding-farmers-washington-washington-3?not_recommended_start=90;Vicky P.;2;04/05/2019;Upon reflection we wondered whether this place was trading on complacency and its laurels. We went in to Founding Farmers based on some previous reviews we'd read about locally whilst staying in DC. To say we were underwhelmed is the succinct summary. To elaborate, the finest piece of the meal was the prosciutto bread starter with balsamic and figs. Thoroughly recommended. The mains however were just 'meh', to use a colloquialism. My seven cheese Mac and Cheese tasted of no cheese, and the crab cake main my husband ordered could have been the 'cake' but with no crab, such was the lack of flavour and strength from the crab meat. To be honest the service was also disappointing. Our 'server' didn't actually bring us anything during the meal. We asked another member of staff to chase the drinks after waiting a good 7-10 minutes for them, and these we were bought along by another apologetic member of staff. The mains were served by another member of staff again. The amusing thing was when we paid, our original 'server' then had the cheek to suggest we hadn't tipped enough based on the 18% baseline!! Not sure such an approach is that professional or reflection of what the restaurant is supposed to be about? Feel free to go yourselves, and we may have been the 'Friday Special' but our view is tainted I'm afraid.;Burnham-on-Sea, United Kingdom;0;1;1326;232;0;0

When we got there noticed it was quite crowded, so I assumed that this restaurant must be so good. However, we didn't get seated until about ten minutes after 3:00. I assumed it was most likely because it was so crowded. When we were seated, they brought us four glasses for water. However, there were five of us and they told us they would get us another glass. It took them over fifteen minutes to bring us the other glass and kept telling us they would bring the glass. When ordering drinks, my sisters and I order Coke. They brought us the glass without the Coke and came back to us later with three cans.We were there for over an hour before we were even served. And when they brought it to us, even though we asked for certain things and sides with our order, they didn't give us what we exactly asked for. However, we were fine and continued eating.

It was cute that they have a mini bookshelf with books for children and adults to read however the books were old and ripped. The waiting area was small so people were forced to wait outside. When seated, there were no server until a while later. I got the blue cheese balsamic bacon burger. It was average, I had better, but the value for the burger was decent. We also got the signature steak and the steak was burnt! We had it medium, it was definitely well done and burnt. We couldn't rip the burnt pieces out either because it was stuck onto the meat. The steak was really small and thin, not worth it's value. Another thing, I read the reviews about the dirty glasses. Our waiter came with the glasses and it was really dirty, I didn't even want to touch it or drink from it. So I ordered hot water. The cups were filled with coffee stains!! I was really disappointed with everything. I think it's about time for them to change a whole new set of cups and glasses. Everything is really old and disgusting. Wouldn't recommend this place.

Even though I don't like this noisy, crowded and pretentious place my wife had already made reservations. We arrived five-six minutes early and asked for our table. Since our party of four were not complete we were encouraged to have drinks at the bar. Eventually we were seated on the second floor. As soon as we ordered our food the waitress started going through the dessert list. As Dave Barry would say ""I am not making this up."" Non stop. She told us that since it would take sooooooo long to get the desserts we should order them as soon as we could. This is even before our food have arrived. Obviously the message for us was order and eat as fast as you can and get the hell out..My cheezburger (they have some fancy name for it) was not bad but the fries were horrible. Greasy burned pieces of potatoes laboriously scraped from the bottom of the pan. When I complained the server suggested that I order side order of fries.

It was overcooked and when I sent it back, I got a greasy, oily slop. Seriously? For damn near $30 it shouldn't make me sick. The red velvet cake was good. A little overwhelming in the sweet department but that's how red velvet is supposed to be. The macaroni and cheese is meh. I've definitely had better. The fried chicken was.... well, if you're from the North, maybe thats acceptable fried chicken. All in all, if the waiter hadn't comped my drinks and apologized profusely for things out of his control- he even said that their managers were still getting the hang of ordering food- I would give this one star.

The food was okay, nothing out of this world. I had the eggs Benedict for breakfast, and the egg ended up being a bit overcooked for my liking. The potato on the side was also meh making the entire experience memorable for not the right reasons.;Brooklyn, New York, NY;0;12;393;76;0;0

Otherwise just overrated if you get my drift. And brunch is only worth it if you love to stuff yourself. We had the chicken fried steak and shrimp and grits. The chicken fried steak just had my mouth watering--but only before I actually ate it. It was not much better than one at an I-Hop. Shrimp and Grits a bit better. With the competition they should be better. Breakfast is good though if you want a lot of food.;Alexandria, VA;8;16;479;89;1;24

We made early reservations for 4:30 so that we'd be able to eat casually before our concert at Capital One arena. We were glad we went early on that Friday night because it really started getting busy around 6. We ordered the Brie and Cornbread for our appetizers. My wife ordered the crispy chicken salad and I ordered the Chicken and Waffles. The chicken was so juicy, that on my first bite, it squirted juice almost to the other table :).

Founding Farmers - Washington;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/founding-farmers-washington-washington-3?not_recommended_start=210;Bethany S.;3;04/07/2018;Had to make it here during my brief trip to DC because it has thousands more reviews than any other restaurant rated on Yelp. Because of this, I mistakenly thought it would be incredible. We were finally seated after waiting thirty minutes for our 8:45pm reservation . However, the restaurant was bustling so I told myself it would be worth the wait. We ordered the chicken wings as an appetizer - these were pretty tasty - but we were most excited for our entrees: shrimp bucatini and chicken pot pie. These were both let downs (although the pot pie had a beautiful, flaky, golden-brown crust). I understand the allure of farm to table but at the end of the day, it's not something you can rely on to make your food taste good. I could see myself liking this place way more than I did if the food wasn't so bland.;Dallas, TX;6;29;814;151;1;10

The food is great, atmosphere is nice, and overall it's a great restaurant but it has seen a slight decline in overall quality. Unfortunately their reservations seem to be meaningless, and if you have a 7pm youll probably be seated by 8, which is very annoying.

I took my my boyfriend there for the first time a few weeks ago and realized that while the ambiance and concept are good, the place is overrated. There are now many restaurants in DC that do the farm fresh concept well, Founding Farmers is just average. We got the Farmhouse Platter and Pimento Cheese farm bread to share. Both were A-OK, nothing bad but nothing that makes you say wow. The chili on the farmhouse platter was the best part. We also got a few drinks, all of which were tasty but small and overpriced.

I was sitting in the bar area for a lunch and ordered a glass of ginger ale with my meal. The bartender served my drink with a small glass. When I asked why my glass was small, he said I did not want ice. I was very surprised with the fact that they were so cheap. If you prefer your drink without ice for any reason which you maybe sick or don't like the taste of drink with ice, you will get a half size of drink even though it is a cup of ginger ale.During my last few experiences in the Founding Farmers, I also found the food was not excellent on taste or presentation as it used to be.;Washington, DC;2;1;690;139;1;0

Food was great as always. I ordered the salmon and my girlfriend ordered the chicken and waffles. She could not finish it but she said she loved it, and I have had it before and it is very good. Only reason I'm giving 3/5 is because I had a 7pm reservation and called at 6:30 to say that I would be 10 minutes late. The hostes told me to push my reservation to 7:30 because they only have a 15 min grace period. I could have made it before the grace period bit we both agreed to be on the safe side path the reservation to 7:30. When we got there at 7:25 we had to wait until 8:05 for our table to be ready. I understand the food is good and you guys our busy because of people like me telling my friends about this place. The this is its bad business to overbook yourselves past capacity.

Well, if you were expecting a crispy southern buttermilk fried chicken then you will be very disappointed as I was. The chicken was not crispy (how can you make fried chicken not crispy its beyond me?) You get two small pieces and one tiny side and some starch for $16, no farmers or farmers wannabee wants to pay for that. Yes, its in Dc and its on Pennsylvania Ave, but if you're going to call yourself a Founding Farmers and charge non farmer price then your fried chicken should be crispy and juicy. So my search for great Fried Chicken will continued but not at Founding Farmers.;Reston, VA;13;5;681;126;1;1

I took my family there to celebrate my son's graduation from high school. He wanted to go to Old Ebbit, but I hoped to provide him with an alternative that i believed was equally as good as our traditional, family dining place.First off, the host (some guy at the front who was not friendly or nice) that greeted me and my family looked as if he were having a bad day. I soon realized that this was his personality. Okay, you DO NOT put someone like this upfront to greet your customers or regulars...FAIL! Secondly, the waitress: she was very nice and responsive, which allowed me to recover slightly. Next, the food: not as good as I was hoping it would be for my family's first visit. The signature meal that my wife and daughter ordered (chicken and waffles) was not good: the chicken was over-cooked and dry and the waffles were way too crispy. The mac 'n cheese side was...okay.The tastiest dish and prize-winner goes to the mini burgers...delicious! The friend green tomatoes were good, too.

ANYHOO, as a foodie, and as someone who appreciates good quality food, FF half meets the bill. Ive eaten here a grand total of 7 times now. The food is good, sometimes great, but never excellent. I still think Agraria does a better job on seafood- especially mussels.. oh god. The vegetarian options, minimal... unless you REALLY enjoy salad... So here are a few ideas- make a reservation to avoid the group tables (seriously? communal tables...), drinking (farmer jons, especially) helps make the experience and long wait more enjoyable/tolerable, and avoid that nasty pear flatbread and the overcooked potato chips. My picks: - southern chicken salad- the halibut- french fries- french dip sandwich (OMG!!!!!! the only amazing thing on the menu)- apple pieConclusion: I'd never spend my own cash on anything but the prime rib sandiwch.. and the bar... BUT, if someone's treating you, it can be okay..;Washington, DC;0;9;1014;172;0;0

Otherwise, FF was a good experience. Good fried green tomatoes and red velvet cake -- wasn't too crazy about my meaty entree, but that's my fault for accepting the hearty dish suggestion even though I'm deficient of carnivorous tendencies. Despite this, I LOVED their water. Best water I've ever had in my life. Make sure to stay partially-dehydrated when you dine here because you are going to want that triple-carbon-filtered water.

Inside dining was pleasant, if a bit noisy. Our waitress was very nice and everything was correct. The crab cakes were excellent as was the Yankee pot roast, which featured the expected tender and flavorful beef and vegetables that had not been over-cooked, as can so easily happen with that dish. The French fries were over-salted, but otherwise nicely prepared from actual fingerlings of potato, and the blueberry crumble ice cream was, sadly, bereft of much flavor or a sense of being made with cream. The wines were good and comparably priced to neighboring restaurants. So: food 4.5/5, service 5/5, ambiance 4/5 and value 4/5. I would give this restaurant 4.5/5 stars if that were an option.;Rockford, IL;1;40;728;124;1;26

We went around 7:30 PM and the bar was busy as well as the restaurant itself. It was really nice inside with lots of great decoration. The bartenders and waiters/waitresses were AWESOME as well, super kind and knowledgeable about the menu. We started off with the fried green tomatoes which were SO GOOD. They come with 2 dipping sauces. For my meal, I got the crazy corn chicken salad. I took off a star though because unfortunately, my corn salad came without corn I ordered this salad looking forward to the roasted corn but there was just no corn which was definitely very disappointing in my opinion. However, as for the ingredients that did make it to the salad, the food was very good. They forgot to bring out the cornbread that it is supposed to come with, so I asked for some on the side and it was definitely very good! Though not pictured, my mom got the goat cheese ravioli with chicken cutlet which was super tasty - I'd definitely recommend that!! My dad got the short ribs with mashed potatoes and he seemed to love them. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place, I was just slightly disappointed that my salad was missing the key component.;PA, PA;0;34;1221;219;0;30

The eating place is HUGE, modernly decorated, and serves remarkable food! One downside is that it gets super crowded, so make sure to return EARLY to avoid crowds. I arrived on a Sunday morning at 10:30am and I was told there was a forty five minute wait already! I turned into inclined to attend it out, however thankfully I overheard that the bar seating turned into first come first serve if it became open - so I requested the host to exchange me to the bar seats instead. Definitely attempt to choose bar seating to avoid lengthy waits. While it changed into the first-class option - the workforce did now not offer this statistics up readily, that is why I gave it 4/5 stars.Food - I ordered the chicken + waffles (which came with a aspect!) and their signature cup of coffee. My bf ordered the eggs benedict with a facet of fruit and their iced coffee. Both dishes have been AMAZING - I couldn't maintain my fork down. Service seemed to be a bit gradual on the grounds that they looked a bit understaffed, that's what introduced to the wait times.

I have been here numerous times, never really disappointed but also not extremely impressed. Its a good place to eat with friends, chat and try out fun new drinks. It has good chill atmosphere and the service is always fantastic. But why not 5 stars? After you been here couple times, it gets old. There are interesting food menus, but only couple of them are realllyyy good, the rest is... whatever. The wait is always long, and its a little pricey for a place to just hang out with friends and eat. I usually come here when I have friends from out of town because they have always heard of this place. I like the place a lot, I just don't LOVE them.;Annandale, VA;0;8;821;153;0;0

The food was fresh and the menu was varied enough to have a little bit of everything...My friends liked the Fried Chicken and Waffles, but I was partial to the Diver Scallops (over an addictive Risotto). But speaking of addictive, the Bacon Lollies (brown sugar cured bacon on skewers) and the skillet cornbread with honey butter made great appetizers. The DC location seemed smaller, so a party of 10 was a bit of a challenge for them. But both locations are a great place for a good meal with a small group of friends.;Alexandria, VA;0;1;601;108;0;0

It's nice to sample something that you would not ordinarily make yourself at home.I had a Cranberry Brie Vegetable Burger. It was so good!

CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. CHICKEN AND WAFFLES.  I didn't even order the chicken and waffles (my sister did), but I had multiple bites of it and IT. WAS. SO. DAMN. GOOD. The chicken was juicy and tender, while the waffles were golden and crispy. You also get to order a small size with this meal. I actually ordered the lobster mac and cheese. It was decent, but not worth the $29. Very large portion, but felt that the lobster and pasta proportions were 1:5. They didn't drown the dish with cheese, allowing the taste of lobster to surface. Service: Not impressed. Our waiter was not enthusiastic at all. He didn't seem happy to answer any questions we had about the menu or to cater to us in general. Ambiance: Very lively and sociable place. Loud, but you can still hear your own conversations so that's good. Would definitely come here again and again.

The waitress was nice but incredibly busy.If you are looking for a light lunch, this is not your restaurant. The food is delicious but on the heavy side.

Once for dinner on our first night and a second time for brunch on our last day, both meals were great. We had reservations so we only had to wait a few minutes which was a good thing, the wait looked long for walk ins. I had made the brunch reservations just in case they really liked it and wanted to eat there again. Glad I did, because brunch time was even busier. There was 5 of us and we all got something different to type. My son had the chicken and waffles for dinner and picked the mac and cheese for his side, daughter had the Rueben Sandwich (I wish I would have ordered that as well), husband and niece had the fish and chips and I had the spicy Tuna Poke salad (not as good as I have had but it was good) We also tried a couple of appetizers, the fried green tomatoes were really good, wish we would have gotten two orders. Also tried the chips which came with various dips, those were ok but nothing too special. Everyone really liked what they got, no one was disappointed. Now for Brunch - We did a little sharing here, my son and I shared one of the pan scrambles and banana fosters waffle, yummy both were great. Husband had the chicken and waffle which is served a little different for brunch than dinner, he loved it. Daughter had Drag through the garden and Niece had eggs and bacon. She ordered a special bacon but wasn't too happy with it, she she is was more that ham and not bacon. We also got an order of beignets, should have gotten two orders. All in all both meals were great and we will definitely go again if ever in the area. Maybe they should branch out to other locations.;Huntington Beach, CA;4;23;1682;321;1;34

I went to Founding Farmers this weekend for the first time. The portions are big, the food is delish, and the atmosphere is sustainable/modern chic. (And it doesn't hurt to support family farms!) I ordered the homemade pasta ""straw and hay"" which came with a white sauce, corn, peas and bacon. It was so tasty. The drinks are great, too. The only thing that was weird was the waiter we had. He was flirting with my girlfriend at first then got insulting. It was really awkward each time he came to the table. He had a strange personality for a waiter. He tried too hard to be funny, but ended up just being mean. Back to the food....I recommend trying any of the breads as a starter. The one with brie is tasty.

Still, the food was fantastic and I felt it was money well spent.;Washington, DC;2;3;570;101;1;0

The restaurant felt energizing and so we decided to take a bite there. Parking did pose a problem so we had to drive around to find a spot.The place was a classy and a hip one and we were given a window table. The waiter was very professional and warm. The menu was tempting and mouthwatering with a variety of options before us. For a couple like us who go nuts over a variety of menu items, this was very much a treat.We started with the popcorn of the day and the Roasted Tomato Soup. Thereafter we had the Yankee Pot Roast and Rotisserie Chicken. It was amazingly delicious. The chicken was a bit dry but still magical. For dessert we both went for the Red Velvet Cake which is a favorite of both of us.The place is pretty amazing and the food definitely satisfies your palate. Please make reservations and prepare to walk as parking may be tight.;Fairfax, VA;4740;45;995;184;1;17

Founding Farmers - Washington;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/founding-farmers-washington-washington-3?not_recommended_start=840;Erin W.;4;11/15/2013;Ideally, I could give Founding Farmers a 3.5 rating. Their food is eclectic and the ambience is excellent for everything from a brunch with friends, birthday with family, to a nice date night. I love their mission--using locally grown foods for their menu. And their cast iron cornbread gets 5 stars on its own. I'm a veggie/fish eater, so I feel there are limited options at FF in that respect. The vegan/vegeterian options I've tried were not nearly as satisfying as other places. I think if you are a carnivore, this is easily 5 stars, but I've never been blown away by the food (except the cornbread!) and the wait is always pretty long. For me, it's a long wait and expensive for any kind of regular visit, but if you want a fun night out to try some new things (and an excellent drink menu!) then I'd recommend it!;Arlington, VA;4;5;820;150;1;0

Founding Farmers - Washington;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/founding-farmers-washington-washington-3?not_recommended_start=890;Sophie S.;4;1/20/2013;Let's add another review to the 2000+. Was with a huge group - 15+ I would say. We had made reservations but still had to wait around for half an hour after our reservation time, because there was a couple taking up one of the large tables that we had reserved, and having been in food service I get that kicking them out even subtly would kill the tip, so I wasn't overly annoyed. Just really hungry.However, to make up for the wait, we got a few free appetizers. The cornbread- DELICIOUS. Bits of actual corn in it (shocker I know) and server in a small adorable little iron skillet. There were also fried green tomatoes, which tasted just like they sound (breaded hot green tomatoes) but the person that said they actually enjoyed those had a good time, so I'll trust his judgement on those. I got a California Burger (if that's the name, I can't remember, it was a few months ago), and it was delicious. Perhaps a bit expensive for a burger but the taste was excellent. Others said their dishes were fantastic. Took a few tries to get our water, and our waiter was occasionally unnecessarily curt, but it was a Sunday afternoon, so we must have hit a rush or something. Understandable. Overall, a bit expensive, but worth the food. Decor was a mix of rustic/modernish. Cute ^^;Fishers, IN;0;9;1280;233;1;0

As others have said: Make a reservation!The dishes I have tasted: cornbread, popcorn of the day (Old Bay butter) plank salmon with choice of 2 sides (butternut squash and mashed potatoes), scallops with squash risotto, and Ahi Tuna poke salad. The highlights: the popcorn of the day, plank salmon, and scallop dishes were fantastic. Well-cooked, great seasonings, and awesome flavors. The popcorn is a large bowl for $2, making it a great choice for a small group. Flavors rotate daily. The risotto with the scallops is definitely rich, but incredibly tasty, especially if you go hungry! I have also heard great things about the French dip sandwich (it's huge!), steak and eggs, and butternut squash risotto.The not-so-great: I thought the cornbread was quite bland. Perhaps this is why it is served with a side of honey-butter, but I was disappointed. The Ahi tuna salad with fried wonton was good - certainly spicy, for my taste - but my biggest criticism was that the tuna should have been fresher. It was somewhat mushy. I probably would not order it again.The restaurant is large, so it can get noisy, but it's not supposed to be a quiet date spot. I have never had problems with the service, they have a vegan menu, and my friends tell me their homemade drinks/sodas (though expensive) are outstanding. Overall - a great place with a massive menu (good for groups because of the variety) and reasonable prices!;Fairfield, CT;0;20;1516;257;1;28

Everywhere we looked their was a good looking guy walking by.. from the bartenders to the waiters and even the host! I guess Founding Farmers understands that after a stressful day of work all a girl needs is a good meal, good drink and some nice eye candy to look at...... we will definitely be back!;Woodbridge, VA;0;1;768;139;0;0

So this time, I requested an upstairs table when I made the reservation, and I was pleasantly surprised that they honored the request! We had a great table, one of those circular booths. We ordered way too much food, but with such a big menu it's hard to not over-indulge. The cornbread is amazing, as are the fried green tomatoes and the devilish eggs. I have a hard time ordering anything other than the center cut filet, because it's always so delicious, and they always cook it just right.

My husband and I had been planning to try this place for some time as we are both becoming for health conscious. We happend to be in the area and realized we were close to this restaurant. It was later in the evening probably 30 mins before they stopped serving dinner. I really thought that since they were close to closing that they would rush us through our meal. I was pleasently surprised!!! The waiter was very nice and didn't make any suggestions to hint us toward leaving....which was nice. I've never had fried green tomatos but decided to try them.

Then my thoughts went to- wow the bar is crowded. Stopped by on a Friday night happy hr and ended up staying for a delicious dinner. I ordered the deviled eggs appetizer- fairly plain but fresh with sea salt and onion. and for entree, I chose the straw/hay pasta, which was enormous elbow shaped macaroni with mushrooms, peas, pancetta and cream sauce. Outstanding. Everyone seemed pleased with their food. The waitress did a few screwy things with our bill b/c we had 10 people but service was good. Love the barn-like sliding door, and the general feel of being in a rustic place which also happens to be inside the IMF building.

Founding Farmers - Washington;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/founding-farmers-washington-washington-3?not_recommended_start=930;N B.;4;10/20/2008;I loved this place. I tried it in the first week or so that they were open. The space itself is urban chic and a welcome addition to Foggy Bottom. I used to work at 2000 Penn and it would have been great to have had a Founding Farmers nearby during my 5+ year stint in the neighborhood.The drinks... I love the pre-prohibition-style bar concept. They have no pre-made mixers, everything is crafted by hand when you order. They've also put significant thought into how best to keep your drink at its most perfect as you sip... giant ice cubes - leaving you more time to enjoy your beverage before it turns into a less appealing, watery version of its former self.I had the bacon lollis to start.  If you are a pork eater, I highly recommend these! As you walk through the restaurant to your table, if you note the sweet, sweet aroma of bacon, brown sugar and cinnamon (yes, the smell is THAT distinctive)... that would be the lollis. Not to be missed for the non-vegetarian crowd.Since I had bacon to start, I opted for a salad entree. The Spicy Ahi Tuna Poke salad was spectacular! SUPER spicy (so beware) with a wonderful sesame vinaigrette. Having traveled to Hawaii on a number of occasions, I was first drawn to this dish because of the poke (traditional Hawaiian sushi-like dish). While I wouldn't say the ahi was true poke-style, my disappointment at not having traditional poke in this dish was quickly overtaken by my sheer delight at the flavor combination - sweet, spicy... so yummy. I'll go back again and again for this salad (though I certainly hope to try many more items from the menu as well).Overall, a lovely experience. Great place for groups. Vibrant bar scene. Reasonably priced entrees. Oh, and surprisingly large portions... go with a big appetite or plan to eat family-style.;Washington, DC;0;1;1816;317;0;0

The dining hall is relatively big, and there are some tables on the sidewalk outside. We were served by Victor, friendly and professional, who introduced us to Founding Farmers, its philosophy and operations, and graciously helped us with our different choices. The food was very good, tasty and well prepared, with a decent selection of draft beers and a delightfully sinful dessert menu (the Death by Chocolate and the Key Lime Pie were delicious). The place is popular, reserving is almost a must, but even if crowded it was not too noisy, background music was at a reasonably low volume, the overall atmosphere was pleasant and relaxed. The bill for the two of us was $98 plus a well deserved tip. We will be happy to go back if we are again in the area.;Potomac, MD;0;1;841;150;0;0

They play music and everyone is talking loud over it. The hostesses when you check in are nice. However there is only limited standing room in the lobby. So you have to go outside and wait. Only one hostess took the time to actually walk out and call your name. My name was called and skipped over atleast one time and I was 10 mins early and checked in.

Came in ordered some food to-go and sat at the bar while I waited. Gabe gets me water then comes to take my order I told him Im just waiting on a to-go, then he proceeds to see if I wanted a drink. I get a drink a Southside, I watch him make it with so much effort. He slaps the mint I smell it from my seat, he uses his measuring cup to mix the ingredients all while still just talking to me about my day. Of all things to talk about he ask how's your day going. And I had to think about it and it was going well and even better because of this experience. He went to check on my food, brung it to me and told me have a nice day.

I come here often most times its a hit or miss not this time, was a definite hit. There's was a 2hr wait for a table which was crazy but the bar is first come first serve. So I go to the bar in which I see Gabe. Whom in my opinion is one of the best servers I have ever had. I already had a great experience with him at our table 3 days prior so I knew I was gonna be taken care of. and he did just that coffee took a while he went to go get it, food was barley reaching 15mins and he still checked and went to go get our food. He made us feel like he cared about out dining experience, while he was clearly as busy as he can be. all and all great person great energy and great vibes and the white lady Bernie is amazing. As he said himself that lady is his golden standard and the reason why he's tries so hard to be amazing and I love the culture that that bar has.;San Francisco, CA;0;4;913;193;0;0

I'm a mother of 3 kids,I lost my husband 2years ago. He left me and my kids with a lot of debts, student loans, medical bills, tax liens and evictions. The little business I was managing to help my family with was going down, so I called my sister who lives in North Carolina, she introduced me to this Credit Specialist. He did a wonderful job on my credit report. I was amazed when I saw how everything reflected on my profile perfectly. He wiped out the bad items off my report and also loaded my account with $18,000. I got a high score of 786 with a good credit limit. This is all I can say about him compared to other good reviews I read about him on the internet. I will also refer him to anyone out there who is in need of his services. Kindly contact him on REMOTE REPAIR at CLERK dot COM;Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada;0;26;893;172;0;0

I've had their chicken and waffles a few times which is an amazing dish. I've had their meatless vegetable meatloaf- I'm not a vegetarian and it was AMAZING. For an appetizer, I would recommend the Brie bread plate that comes with carmelized onions and apple slices- unbelievable.

Saturday brunch was absolutely packed, but we did have a reservation and only had to wait about 5-10 minutes for our table to be available. They do take reservations and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND making one because there is a constant swarm of people outside waiting for a table. We ordered beignets for the table which were light, fluffy, and perfectly fried. They came with three delicious dipping sauces (raspberry, chocolate, and caramel) that were also perfect. The best part of the meal was the strawberries and cream stuffed french toast. It was simply divine. I would highly recommend this restaurant as long as you are okay with a very loud, bustling environment. It is constantly busy and a little difficult to hear if you are sitting right in the thick of it. However, the food is totally worth it. I can't wait to go back!!;Durham, NC;614;48;954;171;1;89

Served with panang paste, coconut milk, bell peppers and mushrooms, this is the best curry I've had in a long time. I've also tried the seafood here which is delicious, and then there's the Chef's Special that offers a variety of delicacies that can suit almost any palette. The place really lives up to its name, and is not kidding, so don't be surprised if the chicken you order tastes like oranges. The joint has some great poultry dishes too that are worth the taste, and your money.;Lafayette, LA;0;4;852;161;0;0

I recently had my second visit to Founding Farmers and it was just as good as the first a few years ago when the place was not as well known. Now you DEFINITELY need reservations. We went at 10:30am on a Wednesday and it was packed. Luckily we had a reservation.My husband ordered chicken & waffles, which he has never had but seemed like a signature dish. It was fantastic! The chicken tenders themselves were amazing. Obviously breaded and fried fresh to order. A white gravy was served on the side. The waffle was perfect too and served with a cinnamon maple syrup. I ordered the breakfast platter with the most perfectly scrambled eggs I've ever had, sausage, hash browns, and some amazing grilled ciabatta bread. Yum! Of course we had to try the beignets. Out of this WORLD!! With chocolate dipping sauce OMG. So light and airy and powder sugary. Amazing. Order them. They take about 25 minutes so order them when you sit down. The coffee was also great. Service was excellent. Metered street parking was pretty easy to find and it was during the week;Chicago, IL;19;7;1065;190;1;0

Founding Farmers - Washington;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/founding-farmers-washington-washington-3?not_recommended_start=1990;Alex J.;5;12/02/2015;I am a true fan of Founding Farmers. For the past two years, I've gone at least twice a month and have had multiple business meetings there with colleagues. The scene and ambience is great and I've yet to have a bad experience. I'm sure it helps me to know the GM and many of the hosts and servers. I love the quality and freshness of the food selections and the curated cocktails are a welcome surprise. Personal favorites include chicken pot pie, goat cheese ravioli, grilled cheese with roasted tomato soup and more. Since I'm a whiskey man, my drink of choice is the Farmer Jon, which is crafted with Knob Creek bourbon and orange cura?ao and lemon! Mellow and smooth. Brunch is great on weekends and the french toast is a must. I recommend you make some reservations and find out why this place has a wonderful reputation.;Washington, DC;0;2;836;150;0;0

Each experience is fantastic with fresh veggies expertly handled by the chef. I dare you to try anything on this menu. You will return over and over again just like I have. Aside from the fresh handling of all the ingredients, there is an offering for every budget. One of my favorites is the lobster macaroni and cheese. I hate beets, but I eat them here whenever they have them on the menu. In summer I like the shrimp roll and there's always the daily popcorn and the skillet cornbread. In winter there are hearty stews served in individual crocks with bread and salad for around $12.

The corn bread is very moist and pairs great with the honey butter. The chicken bolognese pasta had incredible tasting meat sauce. The chicken and waffles has a lot of food as you get mac and cheese, a thigh and a breast, half a waffle and your choice of side, in which I ordered the green beans. I enjoyed the chicken and it wasn't over cooked and was tender. The waffles were crispy and not soft in which is the way I like it. You can dip your chicken in the gravy and take a bite of the mac and cheese -OR- don't dip it and pair it with the waffles and syrup on top.;San Diego, CA;421;178;612;122;1;21

Founding Farmers - Washington;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/founding-farmers-washington-washington-3?not_recommended_start=2210;Tetsuya Y.;5;11/20/2014;We highly recommend this practice. Our dentist recommended Dr. Orchin for our then 11-year old, but we first wanted to explore other practices that charged less. The less expensive orthodontists said they could not apply braces without first pulling teeth and sending our daughter for oral surgery. After examining our child, Dr. Orchin said none of that was necessary.  He straightened her teeth to perfection in just 21 months.  No pulled teeth, no oral surgery, no nonsense. The braces have been off for over a year, and we are absolutely thrilled with the results.  Paying for braces was going to be a struggle for us no matter who the orthodontist was. We decided to go with Orchin Orthodontics even though he costs somewhat more. For this kind of investment, we didn't want to take the risk that the braces would be totally successful and so we went with the practice with the best reputation. We are 100% happy and feel that we received that value that what we paid for. We will soon send our next child back to Dr. Orchin to have her braces applied.  Note: Wish we had known this when our first child was young, but those who buy dental insurance well in advance of applying braces may be able to cover part of the cost to insurance.;Washington, DC;1;2;1254;221;0;0

And I'm a very picky girl who has eaten at many different DC establishments.Nearly every guy working there is extremely good looking! I don't know if this was intentional by them or if they got extremely lucky but I have to give Founding Farmers props - this is really good for your business! When the girls and I are deciding on a place to have a ladies night out, we all look at each other, smile and say Founding Farmers!The last time the girls and I dined there we had a waiter named Paul who was drop dead GORGEOUS. He could easily be a model or actor if he wanted to. And his smile was sooooo endearing, he seemed like a really down to earth guy. (He has a nice butt too hehe). His service was good and when we come back we will definitely request Paul again. Ladies, stay away, hes all mine!

He didn't serve us and he didn't cook our food so I can be objective. I took 3 out-of-town guests there last week and they were very impressed, as I was. I have been before and I enjoy the food very much, the variety, the taste and the quality are all excellent. As such, I am amazed when I read bad or so-so reviews for this restaurant - that people complain about rude servers or about having to wait a long time. First of all, I have never, ever had anything but excellent service and smiling faces- and the guys there don't know who I am, they are not putting on a show just for me. They just know to be polite and well-mannered. As for having to wait a long time... this is NOT a fast -food, junk-food dump. This is a classy restaurant that makes everything from scratch and good food isn't cooked in a few seconds. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants great food and great drinks. I had the ""dark and stormy"" rum-based cocktail and the 'land and sea"" .The ""land"" was the most tender and moist beef I have ever had. I am not a big red-meat eater, but this was incredible. My guests were extremely impressed and had a wonderful time. They also loved the appetisers- the deviled eggs, the bacon wrapped dates, the fried green tomatoes (one asked for a second order!) and the breads.... We all had a variety of desserts, all of which were excellent, including the cheesecakes , the apple turnover and the vertical banana split. This restaurant has only been open since September, so I commend you all for doing a great job and introducing the 'green' restaurant concept to Washington, DC.";Upper Marlboro, MD;0;1;1726;323;0;0

The perfect occasion came up when she recieved a promotionat her job that was long overdue! To celebrate she wanted to go.....you guessed it Founding Farmers! I got there early and checked in with the hostess who by the way was overly pleasant almost sickeneing but still a welcome change from other places. My wife calls to tell me shes running late, that meant over an hour late that I stood waiting for her. A man approached me and asked if I was waiting for a table, when I said yes but waiting for my wife he asked how long I'd been waiting, we got to chatting and he said he was th service manager there and told me all about the restaurant from the ground up. I explained how my wife had been talking about this place and he seemd genuinley interested which is odd these days, I told him about her big promotion and this was how we were celebrating. My wife eventually arrived and almost immediatley He showed back up(later to find out his name was Simon), and took us to our table upstairs nice booth out of the way. Our server showed up to take our order for drinks and was really pleasant. He left and Simon showed up a minute or so later wth 2 glasses of champagne!!! He said he heard someone had recieved a big promotion and wanted to say congratualtions!! I was blown away....my wife was hea over heels in love with this place immedialtley!! I've been married for 6 years and this was by far our best dining experience ever, and we eat out 3 times a week. The food was awesome and the service was extra attentive!! Thankyou Simon and Founding Farmers for setting a new precedent in dining!!! p.s my wife works in DC and will be in for lunch with co-workers!;Baltimore, MD;0;1;1899;359;0;0

Not only was my visit long overdue, but so is the concept of this forward-thinking restaurant. We need ""green"" restaurants like this. Apart from my visit being long overdue, it was certainly well-worth it. We were greeted and seated in a timely manner by well-mannered and friendly staff. The atmosphere and general ambience were very pleasant, the background music was low and did not disturb the conversation. It was important to me that the bar staff and the wait staff were extremely knowledgeable about the restaurant's products. They have one heck of a range of scotches, bourbons and other liquors, it was amazing. The cocktails are unbelievable - and what a good time we had trying to decide which one to have, (we'll be back for more!). Then there was the food.... Those fried green tomatoes were so tasty and I loved the sauce and cheese served with them. The steaks were cooked wonderfully, the crab cakes were the absolute BEST, everything was superb and presented in a mouth-watering way. Thank you, we loved it.

We were coming with another couple whom we absolutely wanted to try the place but they canceled at the last minute. Luckily I'd have to say, in retrospect. The service was so unprofessional. We had the Chefs Table which we've gotten every time. We had to get up for silverware, ask to have them change out the plates after a few courses only to have them drop the used silverware on the table. Even the food was not to par except the paella which was excellent. Hard broccoli, hard churros, les Jambon than usual (by far). They kept forgetting bread and we waited 10 minutes for some olive oil. I had a white sangria and it was 75% Ice. Didn't order a second one even though It was my birthday because i didn't want to pay $12 for a cup of ice.

Le Diplomate;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/le-diplomate-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Josephine Henrietta D.;1;11/06/2024;"Le Diplomate? - more like ""Le Dictateur""I'm a tourist, from Denmark, a woman, travelling alone, looking to get a small meal in the quiet company of my book. Only here shortly, I have been told ""Le Diplomat"" is an institution. So I go, in the safe assumption that one person can squeeze in without a reservation. Little did I know. I arrive at the restaurant seeing plenty of tables available outside. Relief. Being Scandinavian November Fahrenheit's is no bother. Inside, I approach the seaters. ""Le Diplomat"" was undergoing a technical system-update, so no walk-ins, only at the bar. However, the bar is completely full. I am not allowed to sit outside. Bummed, I exit the restaurant and wonder, if this place is system-dictated, can I book a spot via the system? Within two minutes, I have a reservation in an hour. Being already at the restaurant, now with a reservation, I figured they could seat me at one of the many available outside tables until my reservation. The seaters were shocked. It shouldn't have been possible. But now I'm a customer with a reservation. A manager is called in. It is probably the least diplomatic service I have ever received. The manager repeats the message of ""system update"" and something about maintaining the service level at an ""even flow"". Might I remind that I'm one person, not a company of six. Speaking faster, mechanically and in a cutesy voice, does not make the irrationality of a message less evident. More humorous really. We were surrounded by empty tables. I end up being practically hunted out of the restaurant. As a European I left the place in shock. What happened to normal level-headedness and simple problem-solving? Nevermind a system update, in Europe a ressouceful floor-handler would have solved the situation with more elegance. Because of technological updates to a restaurant system, all regular human empathy and logic seemed out the window. I left the place feeling more lonely than I had in a long time. I had just witnessed a world without rationality. On the night of the 2024 election, in a time where human connection is more needed than ever, I spoke to a wall. The kind of indoctrinated repetition of ""system update"" from everyone standing next to empty tables in the tenths, made ""Le Diplomat"" resemble more ""Le Dictateur"", than a rational, critical thinking, independent diplomat, capable of what we in Europe call a little flair.";Washington, DC;0;1;2408;407;0;0
Le Diplomate;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/le-diplomate-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Valerie C.;1;07/06/2024;This establishment excels in creating an outdoor dining experience that rivals the Sahara desert in peak summer. The outdoor seating area, which was supposed to offer a refreshing experience, was more akin to an oven. The lack of shade combined with the blazing sun made me question if I had stumbled into a survival reality show.The food, when it eventually arrived, did little to redeem the situation. While the dishes themselves were passable, the heat had sapped any appetite we might have had. It was a challenge to focus on flavors when all I could think about was how quickly I could retreat to an air-conditioned refuge.The prices were exorbitant given the conditions. Apparently, the privilege of baking in their outdoor sauna came at a premium. I left Le Diplokate drained, dehydrated, and questioning my life choices.In conclusion, unless you have a fetish for sunburns and enjoy the sensation of your clothes adhering to your body like a second skin, I'd advise against dining at Le Diplomate.

I'm not a big person when it comes to writing a review so I'm gonna say it as it is. We were sitting in this room with green walls and hanging vegetable pots towards the end of the room and as I looked towards my left, by this fridge I spotted the most disgusting thing ever. Not outside, not the patio area, this is by the fridge where probably food was stored. I hate to break it to you but a rat the size of a small kitten run towards what it appears to be a soda machine. We paid the tab without saying a word and left and will never go back to such a place again.

Le Diplomate;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/le-diplomate-washington?not_recommended_start=20;C. D.;2;11/26/2024;The quality here has declined substantially, at least with respect to the burgers. As a self-described burger connoisseur, I had bragged to my out-of-town guests visiting DC that Le Diplomate makes one of the tastiest hamburgers in the city. They make a bare-bones smash burger with good meat, cheese, pickles and buns. So imagine my disappointment when we went there in early November specifically to enjoy the burgers, which I've had many times before, and out came three sad looking shrunken sandwiches. The buns were over-toasted, especially the bottom buns which were stiff and hot to the touch (not warm and toasty). The two patties were beyond well done and flavorless. The sandwich itself was sloppily assembled and overloaded with sliced raw onions. The total effect and presentation reminded me of what you'd expect at McDonald's, not one of the most respected restaurants in the city. Cost per burger: approximately $26 each (with no sides). None of us finished the burger. After over-selling Le Diplomate to my friends I had to apologize, and we laughed it off. We did enjoy our drinks and fries on a beautiful sunny day but I was surprised at the indifference to quality and brand and how starkly different the burgers were from my prior visit. I should point out that the service was great. Our waiter was prompt, friendly and professional and immediately established rapport with me and my friends. Had he not been so personable we might have sent the food back but we did not want to offend. On another subject, there was no toilet paper in one of the men's stalls at noon on a weekday. I had to request help from a good Samaritan.;Washington, DC;0;2;1659;284;0;0

Le Diplomate;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/le-diplomate-washington?not_recommended_start=20;Agnes M.;2;1/23/2021;I made reservations a week ago for dinner for my birthday yesterday. I've never eaten here before, and was very much looking forward to it. When I arrived, I stood in the line to check in where a family cut in front of me. The mother looked at me and since I didn't say anything, they just stood there and assumed their place in line. They did not have a reservation and the hostess was explaining to them the wait and more than likely when they could be seated. They moved to the side and when I checked in, one of the hostesses seated me right away. When I made my reservations, only outdoor seating was available. She led me to my table and to my dismay, it was the worst outside table. It was uncovered and right next to the sidewalk with a heater. I was very upset as I could see the other outdoor tables that were covered and/or enclosed. After a few minutes I asked the hostess if there were any other covered or enclosed tables/booths available. Of course she said no and did not even look at me. My server then came and I quickly gave me order as I told him that was upset and just wanted to order my food and get out of here. He took my order and I noticed there were now people eating inside. So I asked the hostess again of any seating available inside, and received the same answer. Not too long after that, I noticed the family that cut in front of me. They were now seated comfortably in one of the enclosed separated booths. By this time I was almost ready to walk out, which is what I should have done. My food came quickly, and I ordered the escargot, steak frites and profiteroles. The only bright side to this fiasco was that the food was very good. My server brought my bill and I was comped for the dessert. I was out of there in just an hour, which was an hour too long for me. I don't understand why society had this stigma with parties of one. It's always the same with restaurants, hotels and traveling in general. I believe it's because businesses believe that since you are just one person, you will not order as much as a party of six and therefore will spend less and not leave as much of a tip. So they seat you at the crappiest table, or give you the hotel room that is facing a wall. I was so disappointed and it was a terrible way to end my birthday.;Seattle, WA;0;3;2310;443;0;0

The first time, I had a slice of quiche and two glasses of wine. With tip, 40 bucks. The second time, steak frites and one glass of wine. With tip, 50 bucks. So, work with me here: 28 dollars for steak frites?! Were they flown in from Paris? Because otherwise I'm not really understanding the markup on hanger steak. Not prime dry-aged Porterhouse at an expense-account steakhouse. Hanger steak. With not the best frites in town by a long shot. Twenty-eight dollars. I know that the steak in steak frites isn't supposed to be filet mignon, but it ain't supposed to cost like it is either.If the steak frites were blow-my-mind good, maybe I wouldn't begrudge the owners the aforementioned crazy-ass prices. But they're not. I've had blow-my-mind-good steak frites, in Paris that, even with a strong Euro at the time, did not cost me 28 dollars. For decent hanger steak and just-OK frites, I'd pay 15 bucks and still not feel like I'm getting a bargain.So, if you have to go, order something light and enjoy the ambience. It's a pretty restaurant. The service is generally attentive. But this place is not even vaguely a great value. And it'd get its ass handed to it in Paris.;Washington, DC;0;2;1332;229;1;0

Those without reservations will be seated in an enclosed off area outside the restaurant, an area quite quaint and very representative of the french-caf¨¦ experience. A basket of fresh bread was given, with wonderful diversity in bread choice (with the fruit bread being wonderful). We started off with the mushroom tart, quite disappointing upon trying a bit of it. The appetizer would have been exponentially better if the tart was replaced with a light puff pastry (which parallels with the french cuisine). The tart itself was at room temperature, which it was supposed to be according to the non-reservation manager, but ultimately, it was unappealing. Entr¨¦es were the steak frites: the cut of the steak was definitely of a lower quality, but still delicious and perfectly cooked. The frites were well fried, but were a tad too oily. The moules (mussel) frites dish was well made, though the dish's sauce was a bit too pungent with bay leaf that took over the mussel flavor. However, a member of our party ordered the dover sole - something not in Balthazar - and was absolutely delicious. The almonds well complemented the fish to an extent that was perfectly matched and the accompanying sauce was decadent.Our waiter was a tad rude, especially after we notified them about the temperature of our appetizer, but overall, the feel of the restaurant was nice.

Le Diplomate;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/le-diplomate-washington?not_recommended_start=60;Robert H.;3;5/19/2015;in all honesty.. love french bistro. hands down one of my favorite concepts in the restaurant scene. having been to bouchon and several other bistros across the country, (sadly never in france) I have never had a stellar experience here. great service. great energy. food is well executed but not amazing mostly this is a review from my fiancee who is french Canadian. who loves all things french. I took her here for her birthday and she was not happy at all. too loud. which I know the rickety wood floors are the mark of any good bistro. the food (which I have now had twice (one other time during a biz meeting). never over the top.. several dishes that do not fit a french bistro like the Moroccan lamb with cous cous did not impress. the escargot on my first visit was well executed but did not knock my socks off. the veal scallopini was ver redundant in flavor but lack luster half way through the dish (both of my dinning companions had it). not trying to bash the chefs of le diplomat at all as they are performing their jobs in execution well. conceptually need some improvements. I will still return for the burger as I hear it is the best in city. I haven't given up on you le diplomat.;Arlington, VA;0;6;1199;223;0;0

The French onion soup was delicious, and my drinks were well-made, but my steak was unfortunately overcooked, which was disappointing for a restaurant of this caliber. Despite that, the space itself is absolutely beautiful, and I did enjoy the overall ambiance and experience. I'd still recommend giving it a try, but maybe with slightly tempered expectations.;Southwest, Denver, CO;4;21;473;76;1;58
Le Diplomate;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/le-diplomate-washington?not_recommended_start=70;Critics World ..;4;6/15/2024;La Diplomat: A Culinary Experience with Highs and LowsLa Diplomat offers a tantalizing blend of French cuisine with a few noteworthy dishes that transport you straight to the heart of France, though some items left something to be desired.Starting with the house bread and butter, it was an impeccable introduction to the meal. The bread had the perfect crust, and the butter was rich and creamy, rivaling the best I've had in France. It set high expectations for the rest of the dining experience.The shrimp salad did not disappoint. Each shrimp was prepared to perfection, tender yet firm, and the sauce was a delightful balance of tart and creamy. This dish was a standout and one I would eagerly recommend and order again.Unfortunately, the beef bourguignon did not live up to its promise. While the broth was flavorful, and the potatoes and vegetables were cooked to perfection, the beef itself was a letdown. It was chewy, dry, and tasted old, which is disappointing for a dish meant to be rich and tender from slow-cooking in wine sauce. It seemed as though the restaurant was using subpar or leftover beef, which detracted significantly from the dish.However, the meal ended on a high note with the cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e. The crust had the ideal crunch, giving way to a cr¨¨me that was sweet and absolutely mind-blowing. It was a perfect conclusion to the evening, showcasing the restaurant's ability to execute classic French desserts with finesse.Adding to the experience, the service was exceptional. M waiter was knowledgeable and super professional, enhancing our dining experience with attentive and courteous service. Additionally, the vibe at La Diplomat was immaculate, creating an ambiance that perfectly complemented the meal.Overall, La Diplomat provides a mixed experience. While some dishes shine brightly, others need improvement. Nonetheless, the highlights make it worth a visit, especially for the bread, shrimp salad, and cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e.;Lake City, FL;143;68;1952;312;1;50

Ordered drinks. They we good, not great. I had the quiche Lorraine and side salad. Only offered a vinaigrette dressing which was good. Probably had the dressing added prior to serving as the lettuce was a bit wilted, not as crunchy and crispy. Quiche was a huge portion. Wish it would have been served hot, it was Luke warm at best. The steak frites was really delicious, tender and the French fries well seasoned. Others had the hamburger and all were pleased with their meal.

The ambiance strikes a perfect balance between casual and elegant, making it an inviting dining experience. To truly savor your visit, I highly recommend making a reservation in advance, as the place tends to get quite busy, especially on weekends.Now, let's talk about the star of the show - the French onion soup. It's an absolute delight that will tantalize your taste buds with its rich flavors and warm, comforting goodness. Definitely a must-try!The staff here is friendly and attentive, which adds to the overall positive dining experience. Their genuine warmth makes you feel welcomed and well taken care of.Although the food is generally good, I must admit that the prices are relatively high. However, it's not surprising given the location in Washington, DC, and the popularity among food enthusiasts. For those who appreciate a delightful culinary adventure, the expense is well worth it.In the spirit of constructive feedback, I'm giving LeDiplomate 4 stars.

DC has a lot of French restaurants, but none with the service and grandeur of this place. The service is always excellent, even when they're busy. They developed a nice streatery during Covid with different kinds of creating seating options. That will be much appreciated as the weather warms up again. You can't go wrong with the classics, like a perfectly cooked Steak Frites or Beef Bourguignon. Always get the bread basket. The escargot are also delicious and full of garlicky goodness.

I've been coming here since it first open, and it is one of the best additions to the 14th street corridor. I love the vibe, especially in the cafe style area, creating this bistro style environment. You sometimes feel transported into a Parisian cafe. The french onion soup is perfect in the winter, you can't go wrong with the steak frites, and the dishes are usually all delicious. I love the raisin bread provided in the bread basket with the whipped butter. It's a great place to group for brunch with friends or meet for dinner after work. I've also haven't had a problem taken family members who have brought their children. I highly recommend making a reservation to be seated, I'm not sure if they take walk in.

Le Diplomate;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/le-diplomate-washington?not_recommended_start=140;Simon B.;4;09/04/2018;I had been trying to visit le diplomate for quite some time, but reservations aren't easy to find. I randomly checked opentable the day of and was able to snag a reservation for Friday 6pm by checking!A big part of the appeal is the reputation, and that's fine. But it's also important to recognized that this is a well oiled machine. Whereas we had to wait longer than we would have liked to have our waiter come, it was a Friday evening and he paid good attention when he arrived. I had the burger, she had the mussels. A cocktail and a beer. The burger is frequently in the list of best DC burger. It was good, and with a nice presentation, but I'm not sure I'd put it in my top 10. The bun wasn't particularly fresh, the patties were dry and not particularly flavorful. The preparation for the mussels was classic, served with plenty of fries and fresh bread. Unfortunately, out of a bowl, more than 10 were not open (i.e., the mussels were bad) and some were just dirty. She was pretty dissapointed, and eventually asked if it was usual to have so many unopened. He said no - and offered to get a few more. That ended up being an entire other portion of mussels! It was a nice touch, we didn't expect that. We left understanding both the lovers and the haters. The diplomate is a unique DC institution, worth trying at least once. We wouldn't necessarily order either of our dishes again, but can totally see ourselves going back.;Washington, DC;121;521;1435;265;1;329

Le Diplomate;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/le-diplomate-washington?not_recommended_start=150;Richard H.;4;4/17/2018;"Our dinner at Le Diplomate (which I will call Diplo for short, and for my own amusement) was like a fireworks display - all ooohs and aaaahs from the table, which included my two picky-eating kids. Diplo's owners reportedly poured $6.5m into transporting beltway hacks to Paris. Variously called a ""bistro"" or ""brasserie,"" to me it feels more like an upscale caf¨¦, a la Les Deux Magots on the Rive Gauche. Or, more directly, like NY's Balthazar with more sidewalk seating.Whatever you call it, you can call it lovely. The main room is lit with the incredibly flattering peach lights that illuminate Balthazar, but unlike the cave-like NY boite, there is a sunny tiled section that features an enormous ""Laundromat"" sign, and plenty of outdoor seating. Tables are unclothed, and chairs are classic woven caf¨¦ seats. Service is professional and felt very Gallic, helped along by our server, who sported a heavy French accent. The menu isn't huge, but leans heavily towards traditional French standards like beef bourguignon, duck leg confit, and Moules Frites. I had the latter, which was marinere-style, and was wonderful. The fries were similarly superb and served with mayo on the side. My eldest daughter had a bib lettuce salad, which she loved, and my youngest took down the mac & cheese after being talked out of the Thursday plat du jour of Dover Sole, which, at $52, was a non-starter anyway. It took all my willpower not to finish off that marvelous cast iron skillet of mac, cheese, and gout-inducing cream. My wife had the salmon, and hoarded it (there is a pattern there...)  We also shared a charcuterie platter and three cheeses, which had to be rationed because everyone wanted to eat the whole thing.Desserts were terrifyingly perfect. A chocolate tart with whiskey ice cream, a perfect cr¨¨me brulee, and profiteroles that my 8 year old is still dreaming about. You can certainly spend a lot of money at Diplo, with some entrees hovering in the $30 range, no kids menu, and a list of starters that beg to be ordered en masse. Not to mention a very, very tempting wine list featuring over a dozen well-selected champagnes, including some Jebs (that's what the cool kids call Jeroboam-sized bottles, which hold 4 750ml bottles each). But I felt we got good value, and extraordinary quality, for the benjamins.

And indeed, the decor and food are pretty much what you'd expect from a bistro in Paris - albeit a large one. Overall, I'd rate the food as very good, but not outstanding. The bread was really good. The french onion soup on par with what you get in Paris. The beef bourguignon very tasty, but the beef itself was a bit overdone and slightly dry. Without the sauce, mushrooms, and potatoes, it wouldn't have been that enjoyable. I finished my meal with a cappucino. This was, unfortunately, distinctly less good than the rest of the meal. Better than a Starbucks, absolutely. But not what you'd expect in a good French bistro.So overall, if you crave French bistro food, by all means go.

I love the wine here... Great selection and I've never been disappointed by any glass I've gotten. My favorite is probably the Rose though.

My friend had the Beef Bourguignon, and that was easily what I should have gotten. Tons of flavor. For dessert, Le Diplomat is known for their Creme Br?l¨¦e, but if you're looking for a lesser-known fabulous pick from the dessert menu, go for the Profiteroles.

The service and staff are pretty good. The cocktails and coffee and pastries and bread are well-made. The cocktails are fresh and interesting, so I tried a couple different ones. They have a pretty good menu, from steak frites to omelets and sandwiches and salads. It's in a great, convenient location for walking and people-watching, so it's a good place to go before or after a stroll. I wouldn't advise driving and trying to find parking - it's so busy and crowded in the 14th St area these days - though they do have valet parking. Overall, it's a nice place, not cheap (but where is these days in DC?), and a nice experience.;Washington, DC;0;4;710;129;0;0

No complaints about the food and the service was excellent- perhaps the best I've had in DC. So why 4 stars and not 5? While the food was very good, I did not think it was especially amazing. I felt like the food was about equal to Bistro La Bonne on U St (or perhaps Bistro du Coin by Dupont), but with much better decor and service- and the prices reflect that.;Oakland, CA;125;1166;418;81;1;76

Very, very tasty! However, Le Diplomate only receives four stars from me because the pricing is just a bit too high for what the food is value-wise.Essentially, you will be VERY pleased with the food, but when the bill arrives you probably will come back down to earth a bit off your culinary high. Still, my lasting impression is positive and I can't wait to go back!;Washington, DC;0;7;426;75;1;0
Le Diplomate;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/le-diplomate-washington?not_recommended_start=200;Jennifer D.;4;5/25/2013;We came here on the last night of their 'soft opening' so we got a 10% discount on the total which was pretty sweat.The place was packed and loud. I over heard the manager say they were serving over 700 tables per night, which sounds pretty crazy. I peaked in the kitchen on the way to the bathroom and it was just a total madhouse. It looked like they had about 50 cooks/chefs back there. I also heard him say they were having trouble finding quality staff in DC, which sadly is no surprise, and they actually had to bring a couple of dozen of staff from Philly.The food was good... almost great. For apps we had the escargot (snails yummy!) which was served out of shell, which I've never seen before, but was great. The sauce was extra garlicky and delicious.For the entree we had the duck, which was good but the breast meat was noticeably cooler (cold actually) than the leg/thigh, which was steaming hot. It was obvious they were cooked at different times, so that was a bit troubling. The grilled asparagus side was great, as was the chocolate cream dessert, which was like a big bowl of extra creamy and rich pudding.So I imagine this place will be a solid five stars once they work the kinks our and I look forward to going back!;Washington, DC;60;80;1238;229;1;0

There was a 30-minute wait, but the greeters were welcoming, and the time passed quickly.Despite the rush, the service was great--our server checked in regularly and kept our water glasses full, which I really appreciated. I ordered the Burger Am¨¦ricain with pommes frites, and while it was the most expensive burger I've had, it was absolutely worth the splurge--delicious and cooked perfectly. The bread and sauce really set it off.Overall, Le Diplomate lives up to its reputation.

The bread was slightly burned but the parts around were delicious. The charcuterie was good, but a little salty. The shrimp from the salad (and the buttery sauce) was the highlight of the meal. It was one of the dishes the waiter recommended and we would as well. The steak was cooked exactly to the right temperature, and dipped in the butter sauce from the shrimp salad was a great combo. The waiters were walking around often to see what we needed, so service was great. Definitely recommend a stop!;Manassas, VA;0;5;562;100;0;0

I'm a mother of 3 kids,I lost my husband 2years ago. He left me and my kids with a lot of debts, student loans, medical bills, tax liens and evictions. The little business I was managing to help my family with was going down, so I called my sister who lives in North Carolina, she introduced me to this Credit Specialist. He did a wonderful job on my credit report. I was amazed when I saw how everything reflected on my profile perfectly. He wiped out the bad items off my report and also loaded my account with $18,000. I got a high score of 786 with a good credit limit. This is all I can say about him compared to other good reviews I read about him on the internet.

The space is HUGE with both indoor and outdoor seating. The inside is beautifully decorated. The bread here is SO fresh and tasty - I would have asked for a doggie bag but somehow the waiter snagged the rest of the bread without me noticing. Darn! The bread with raisins/cranberries/nuts was absolutely amazing. For brunch, I recommend the Duck Sarladaise.

Le Diplomate;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/le-diplomate-washington?not_recommended_start=300;Eva A.;5;03/12/2021;The trout is quite possible my favorite trout dish I've ever tried. The slivers of almond gives it this extra texture that is very much welcome, it plays so nicely with the softness of the fish. The haricots verts are also a welcome addition that adds freshness to the fish and the lemon sauce really brightens it all up. This is my second time getting it and I'm already looking forward to my third.For an additional side to go along with my trout, I got the fricasse of mushrooms and it's wonderful if you're a mushroom lover like me! The mushroom soaks in the sauce so well.I also got the mushroom tart to share with my roommate (who also got the trout because we're both in love with it) and wow is this decadent. Definitely something you should share! Not because it's bad but because it's so decadent and full of this wonderful truffle cheese flavor-- you'll want to eat the whole thing but it's a heavy feeling dish!I'm hoping to be able to visit Le Diplomate in person one day because I was definitely more than satisfied with my takeout order!;Agawam, MA;0;3;1052;192;0;0

I ordered the steak frites and it came out perfectly. The steak was cooked to my exact specifications, and the fries were on point. The service also gets a 5/5. Our waitress was attentive yet not overbearing, and the cocktails she got us were mixed perfectly. Definitely recommended. PS: Don't forget to order the bread basket.

Le Diplomate;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/le-diplomate-washington?not_recommended_start=330;Christopher P.;5;02/03/2020;They have the bistro vibe indoors, the outdoor patio area and the indoor greenhouse style space that seems to always be reserved for special events when I'm there. It's pretty loud in there and you can kind of hear the French music. If you want to listen to French music properly, head over to the salle de bain (restrooms) to enjoy some Edith Piaf or other Frenchies.The service isn't the quickest, but you don't go to a French restaurant to eat in a rush. We never had to wait too long to get water or find our waiter to order more, but I would also expect to be there for a while. Everyone is pretty friendly. !We were barely a bite or two into our appetizers when our entrees came out.. They did send them back though, so at least there's that. Usually when, I order duck at these type of restaurants, you either just get the duck breast or the duck leg.I was mind blown when they gave me both, i was so excited to be able to taste both parts of the duck and enjoy the contrast in both texture and flavor....!!!!;Fleming Island, FL;23;15;1016;194;1;8

By far the worst ""Trini"" food I've ever had. Everything was so underseasoned and tasted like almost nothing. The doubles were terrible and the Chana tasted like can metal and no curry flavor. Who puts pineapple pur¨¦e in doubles? The oxtail was terrible. The best part of that dish was the pickled pepper garnish. I am by far so insulted that you guys would take staples from our culture and try to represent our country in such a diverse city and execute so poorly.

Cane;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/cane-washington-3?not_recommended_start=0;Jade C.;2;01/06/2025;"This review is not about the food, but the service. I recently visited Cane with my date, having made a reservation for two. Given the freezing temperatures in the DC area, we requested to be seated away from the door, as our assigned table was directly in front of it. The constant opening and closing of the door made the spot uncomfortably cold.To our surprise, the staff member assisting us--who appeared to juggle multiple roles as a hostess, server, and bartender--responded with an unhelpful and dismissive attitude. Despite the restaurant's small size, we were sent back and forth unnecessarily while being told that our table assignment was fixed because OpenTable dictated it. As someone with experience in the restaurant industry, I know for a fact that changing a table assignment in OpenTable is both possible and straightforward.What made matters worse was the open two-person booth in the back of the restaurant, which was conspicuously available. When I pointed this out, the staff member claimed they couldn't move us because they would ""get in trouble with their manager for altering the seating arrangement in OpenTable."" Their defensive tone and unprofessional attitude completely soured the experience.The encounter left a bitter taste in my mouth--not from the food, but from the lackluster service. It's a shame because Cane is already a small, intimate space, and poor service only amplifies discomfort. Unfortunately, I won't be returning anytime soon, as I have no desire to risk freezing just to enjoy oxtail.";Washington, DC;1;16;1536;246;1;21

This pace is dark dirty and dingy. The serviced is terrible.

Then he clocked out without giving me my bill or even saying goodbye and proceeded to drink a beer near the bar, looking at me. The service was terrible and the manager seemed annoyed that I brought this up to him. I'm not saying it's a race thing, but when you can see you're the only black patron at an establishment and you're receiving a far lower quality of service than other patrons, you can only assume..

Maydan;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/maydan-washington-2?not_recommended_start=0;Ryan H.;2;2/19/2020;Bottom line: The food is good, but the service ruined the experience. The waitress strongly pushed us to order more than we wanted and we were too full to even try the last plate. When the waitress packed up our leftover food, a fair amount of what was left was not boxed up.A one star rating would be unfair because the food was fine, but it is not worth your time or money to go to Maydan. It's all hype and superficiality with none of the high quality service you usually get at DC's nicer restaurants. Go if you want to say you went. Otherwise, get dinner at one of the many truly fabulous restaurants elsewhere in DC.-------I had been trying to make it to Maydan for some time now, but was never able to get a reservation. This past weekend I finally decided to walk in and wait for a table. Although we ended up waiting over an hour-and-a-half to sit down, I had no issue with that, since I knew the place was popular. The restaurant has a cool, hidden gem vibe right from the beginning and is absolutely stunning when you first step in. The open fire in the center of the ground floor gives the whole space a cozy and communal feel. Our table was on the upper floor and the real problems began once we sat down.Our waitress walked us through the menu, telling us that the plates were small, so she recommended 4-6 per person. Neither I nor my girlfriend tend to eat massive amounts, so we went for 3 plates per person (served family style). When we ordered, the waitress told us that as she had said already the plates are small so we should order more and should also add some of the condiments to our order. She then recommended one or two things that she said she liked from each category. We figured we were interested in trying anyway and if the plates were really that small we would need more, so we added another three plates and two condiments. It was way more food than we could handle. The spreads are large and filling: probably enough for four people, but we were two. When we got to the final dishes (the meats) we were so full that it wasn't a particularly enjoyable experience. We only finished one or two of the nine dishes and two condiments and had about half leftover of everything else. Our waitress packed up the leftovers but several of the dishes weren't packed up. Presumably they were thrown away, but I don't know for sure. (Tip: Double check your bill when you get it here. When we got the check, it turned out we had been given the wrong one, which would have doubled our bill. This seems to be a common theme among the reviews.)Overall the food is good, but there are many places in DC that serve better,more interesting, and more complex food. It has top quality Lebanese/Levantine food, but it mainly sticks to elevated versions of tradition (e.g. the muhammara was relatively traditional and really good, the pomegranate molasses added to an already unusually delicious version of the dish).The service and approach are what turn me away. I've never had a waiter insist that I should order more food before, especially in a place that is already pricey. It felt like they were trying to squeeze money out of us rather than welcome us into their community and space.;Northwest Washington, Washington, DC;0;1;3233;586;0;0

Maydan's Middle Eastern cuisine takes you on a culinary journey in the heart of Washington, D.C. Unfortunately, I've encountered issues during my visits. On my second visit, the restaurant implemented a ""service charge,"" presumably due to the increase in servers' minimum wage mandated by the D.C. law. Although I always tip generously, I felt offended by the additional fee. During my most recent visit, I opted for the Tawle menu and experienced an unacceptably long wait of 45 minutes between our last course. This is not indicative of Michelin service.

We got the Tawle menu where they bring out a big variety of all of their foods, and I think generally everything that we had was very good and certainly very filling. The cocktail that I had, as well as the wines that we split for the table, were also delicious. The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous and the central fireplace was very cool, so definitely try to sit indoors if you go and visit.I would say I'd only rate Maydan 4/5 (sadly not full 5), as the service for our table was actually really slow (we spent 3 hours there and were yawning and ready to go by the end). And although the food was delicious, we were surprisingly underwhelmed by the lamb plate (which is also the one with the pretty significant upcharge).Overall a good experience at Maydan and I'd be happy to go back there!;Arlington, VA;307;13;911;170;1;41

We've gone a couple times and both times ended up waiting a couple hours (reservations are almost impossible to get). The place is tiny, so if you're stuck waiting you're probably just going to be standing in the lobby as the bar area is so packed you can barely move. The food is excellent, but if you hit it on an especially busy day, you could end up getting your food sporadically and that makes it hard to enjoy dishes together that are mutually complimentary - such as the carrots and fried cheese. The food is fantastic, but the difficulty of getting in (good luck getting a reservation) has made us decide to pass in favor of equally delicious restaurants elsewhere in DC.;Northeast Washington, Washington, DC;0;7;750;135;0;0

The service team was very professional and meticulous from reception to table, with a warm and measured attitudeAs for the dishes, they were as good as I had heard. The Tawle chicken kebab was succulent and tender on the outside, and the sauce was quite unique and memorable. Next was the rib eye steak, which lived up to its reputation and was cooked with great skill in every bite. For dessert, the rice pudding cake, simple in appearance but with a subtle hint of kelp, was the perfect end to this culinary journeyMaydan is not just a meal, but also a deep dialogue with the taste buds.

Maydan;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/maydan-washington-2?not_recommended_start=40;Barb T.;5;7/25/2021;I couldn't rave about this place more! Went here recently with my hubby for a special anniversary dinner! At first, we didn't have the best experience because they apparently had some pipe burst issue so we had to wait 45 minutes or so. Luckily we had reservations because we were told later on that only reservations were seated because of the pipe issue after we saw some people turned away since they didn't have an RSVP. Regardless, the two women who greeted us and showed us to our seats were very courteous and kind! The waiter was incredible and the food was DIVINE! I would absolutely come here again one day! This place did so well getting us in despite the pipe issue and I look forward to making another reservation!;Washington, DC;0;2;727;131;1;0

Understandable, sh*t happens. Once we arrived, the two ladies at the host stand were extremely accommodating and professional considering the circumstances, and got us checked in and seated as soon as they could. Once we sat, the experience was wonderful and went smoothly. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for an eventful night out.;Washington, DC;0;1;530;88;0;0

These beets were BY FAR my favorite dish of the night, and I'm not even the biggest beet fan. They were topped with goat cheese, spices and a touch of finishing salt that added an awesome crunch and Honorable sauce mention: the toum. Garlic based (maybe skip it if you're on a first date), and fluffy like butter. So delicious. Finaly i said service was excellent as our waitress was very friendly and recommended items that turned out to be very good. She also shared some ideas of how to use the leftover lamb shoulder we took home.

Everything that I've tried has been delicious from the lamb shoulder to the Aleppo kebabs to the whole chicken to the kanafeh.

Astoria DC;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/astoria-dc-washington?not_recommended_start=0;AJ J.;1;6/26/2024;The hostess was so rude! I arrived & walked in apparently 3-4 minutes before they opened, (door was unlocked,) where I was looked up & down & told that I must be in the wrong place by the hostess. I was dressed nicely, not sure what that was about but it was over 100 degrees outside so decided to stay & wait another couple minutes for the rest of my party. If that was all, I would have moved on, but then the hostess told me to go wait outside & proceeded to lock the door behind me when I did so. It was maybe 2 minutes until they were supposed to open, but the hostess was giving me side eye & laughing from inside the door until a few minutes after they were supposed to open. When they finally unlocked the door they immediately told me & the rest of my party to step back a few feet & wait. It would have cost nothing & taken no effort to be kind, at the very least civil. This was not the vibe & the food was greasy mediocre Asian fusion with too much salt. Drinks were fine but I certainly wouldn't go back.;Atlanta, GA;135;7;1017;204;1;0

Astoria DC;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/astoria-dc-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Justin H.;3;09/06/2024;DC Astoria was a big letdown. While the taste was alright, the spice level wasn't there at all, especially for $27. I ordered the double-cooked pork belly, and the portion size was shockingly small. The pork wasn't even crispy at all its an appetizer size than a full entrÃ©e. The hype is overrated, and between the long lines, crowded tables, and lack of parking, it's not worth the hassle.

The honey walnut shrimp stole the show--it might just be the best shrimp I've ever tasted. The food was delicious, and I appreciated the diverse menu options, especially for those who prefer milder flavors. The drinks were also generously portioned. However, service on the patio was a bit slow--we had to signal to different servers for about 15 minutes just to get more water. Additionally, our table was situated at the edge of the patio, and people waiting for tables were leaning against the gate, which made it a bit uncomfortable to eat at times.

The ambiance was a little odd since the restaurant is located inside a bagel shop, but it was still a nice place to enjoy a meal. The staff was very welcoming and friendly, which added to the overall positive experience. I would definitely recommend trying the lumpia and chicken Inasal if you're a fan of Philippine cuisine.;Memphis, TN;352;23;477;81;1;26

I tried it and loved it. I organized a fellowship dinner for my org, the Philippine American Chamber of Commerce of Metro Washington DC and Philippine embassy officials last night and chose to hold it here. It was the best decision. Chef Wing prepared a 6-course dinner of lumpia, pancit, pork belly, ensaladang talong, chicken Inasal with garlic fried rice and Turon. Everything was good and this was served individually, so we were stuffed!! Everyone went home happy. Thanks to Chef Wing, Danny, Joselyn and everyone else. Great service!! 100% recommend!;San Francisco, CA;0;1;642;105;0;7

Drinks were pleasant. Service was good but the ambiance was just awful for me.This is my personal experience. My husband and i went here for a celebration. Made a reservation and had high hopes since a friend of his recommended this place. Had to park in parking garage and walk about 10min in somewhat dark area to get to the restaurant (honestly didnt feel very safe walking after dark)As we walked in, i noticed the place is extremely dark. There are no tables, all bar setting. The decors were pretty nice for your ""social media"" photos, but i didnt enjoy the vibe there. Music was too loud to have a decent conversation with my husband and the person next to me was uncomfortably close to me (touching elbow distance). The bartender had long hair and when he leaned in to grab ice, i saw his hair actually reaching down into fridge/ice area scraping the inside of ice machine. I just didnt feel very good after seeing that. Like i said, drinks were delish, workers were nice in general but thats about all the good thing about that place.

Toki Underground;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/toki-underground-washington?not_recommended_start=10;Victor L.;3;10/17/2011;For me, ramen is one of those foods that has a certain plateau. I don't believe that ramen can reach mindblowing status -- it's a nice broth with a lot of ingredients thrown in, without much room for various textures, contrasting tastes, etc. This belief makes me cap ramen at 4 stars. That may change if I finally have one that is truly mindblowing, but Toki Underground does not serve mindblowing ramen.I began with a side of seafood gyoza. This was disappointing because one cannot tell what types of seafood constituted the filling - if the filling was even seafood at all. I then tried the kimchi ramen. The portions were very generous. However, the noodles were a tad undercooked (e.g. was not chewy and soft, but was chewy and a bit hard), and the broth was a little too salty. The ramen needs a little work and does not compare to the ones I've had in the Bay Area. That said, it is just slightly off. Despite my criticisms, I would go there again if I had a hankering for Ramen, if only the line freed up.*As for the service, I have no complaints. The man at the door was courteous, and the wait staff was nice.*A good solution is to put your name down and pop over to the Queen Vic for some drinks.

After 20 minutes waiting, a nice gentleman took our names and phone numbers on his ipad to call when a table was ready. We passed our info and went to the Pug for drinks and waited 30 minutes for a call on an open a table. Compliments on the efficient reservation/seating system. After we were seated, our server came to greet us & he was pretty friendly. It kind of seemed like he had a sarcastic personality by how he asked & questioned some questions. The restaurant has bar-style seating where you're touching elbows with the person next to you. If you're lucky, you'll get to unintentionally eavesdrop on an awkward first date like my friend and I did. That provided a great source of entertainment for us at dinner.If you are in the mood for some good ramen, I would suggest calling it in to take out as the lines are horrendous and I do not think that you would get that much more out of eating there. However, if eating ramen at the restaurant is something that is necessary, I would suggest that you come close to opening as possible.Overall, definitely my favorite ramen place in DC so far!

Parking is also difficult.Notes: Get a Snow Beauty Sake (a little sweet and cloudy, unfiltered), and a Classic or Curry Ramen with Toki Endorphin Sauce. Arrive between 5-6 if you don't want to wait forever. You could get on the list, and go to Granville Moore's (two doors down) for drinks, and they will call when your table is ready. Also any of the dumplings are great. Toki is heavily Taiwan/Japanese influenced. Also about the parking, Wylie street is the easiest. Turn on 13th St, NE, then turn onto Wylie, which is one way.

Toki Underground;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/toki-underground-washington?not_recommended_start=50;Tom L.;4;02/07/2012;"Having read about Toki Underground many times in the City Paper and due to equal, if not more, insistence from the Girlfriend that we ""must!"" visit - we did.Last week we meet up on H Street for an early dinner in hope that we could get a table (we'd heard it was very difficult to get seated). Well, lucky us. We headed up the stairs, spoke to the host, and immediately got a spot for two on the wall.My love got the ""classic"" (or whatever they call it) and I got the curry ramen (IIRC).The wait for food wasn't bad, although a server initially brought us the ramen meant for another table. TEASE!Not long thereafter our own ramen arrived. It was very good. Early into the meal I sampled my girlfriend's choice and liked it very much. Even so, by the end of my meal I thought the curry ramen was better.My takeaway was that the portions were larger than need be. For as much buzz and press as they get (deservingly IMO), they could charge the same ($10?) for a bowl 2/3s or even 1/2 the size.Anyway, I'll be back - if for no other reason than to scope out all the other new H St. spots I've missed in the past 12 months.";Washington, DC;0;17;1127;215;0;0

Great service, great food, and cheap Japanese beer. I only have two complaints... 1.) Place is very small. The wait has caused me to only be able to go twice. If this place was bigger and could accommodate more people I would go once a week. 2.) It has ""Underground"" in the title and it's upstairs. For some reason that bothers me. I'm sure the name has some meaning I am un aware of that makes perfect sense. As it stands now I'm bothered.";Washington, DC;0;9;497;94;1;0

Toki Underground;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/toki-underground-washington?not_recommended_start=60;Nene K.;4;8/16/2011;I want to go to here all over again.A friend and I waited about 1.25 hrs to get into Toki. It was well, well worth it. I had heard of Toki even before I moved into the DC area. In my opinion, this place lives up to all the buzz. The ramen here is good, y'all. Really good. It's not classic Japanese ramen (probably because the chef is Taiwanese). It's this strange and yummy hybrid of Japanese and Chinese cuisine. Spicy broths, large chunks of pork loin, veggies, and of course ramen egg noodles.I highly recommend the Toki Hakata Classic with Toki Endorphine Sauce (their homemade and very fresh hot sauce). This combination is slurp worthy. My friend tried the kimchi ramen and it seemed too spicy for her -- get it if you like really spicy kimchi. The seafood dumplings were AHMAHZING. Get them steamed, the best. Frying them would dull the sumptuous flavor. Don't do that. Steamed dumplings are better for you anyway. Sit at the bar for the full effect. It's like going to an izakaya! The Kid Robot figurines also give the place a fun and lively atmosphere. The hostess was sweet and the bartender was pretty helpful with recommendations. Oh, and no reservations or take out. Verdict: Save your money -- skip the sake or beer and head straight for the ramen. Just what I needed on a rainy DC day.;San Francisco, CA;173;282;1301;236;1;8

The ostentatious Murano-glass chandeliers hanging from the excessively high ceilings merely serve as a flashy distraction from the lackluster meal that follows. The entire evening feels like a forced attempt at revelry. Loud and obnoxious diners shovel down their absurd 40-layer short-rib-and-truffle lasagna and tasteless Maine lobster Thermidor. The ""duck hunt"" foie gras ravioli at the quartz bar are nothing but a pretentious gimmick. Couples on their so-called ""date night"" can't even salvage the experience with martinis and the uninspired linguine alle vongole. Deshaies may try to channel Michel Richard, but his efforts result in nothing more than melodramatic mediocrity.

From start to finish, this place left me thoroughly unimpressed.Let's start with the ambiance. It was as if they were trying too hard to be fancy and ended up being overly pretentious. The decor was outdated, and the lighting was so dim that I could barely see my food. I get that they might be going for a cozy vibe, but it just came off as gloomy and uninviting.Now, let's talk about the food. It was not only overpriced but also severely underwhelming. I ordered their supposedly ""signature"" dish, ""The 40 Layer Lasagna"" and it tasted like something I could whip up at home with minimal effort. The portion size was laughable (40 THIN layers) for the price they charged, leaving me hungry and dissatisfied.But the icing on the cake was the service. Our server Hector seemed like he would rather be anywhere else but there. He was inattentive, , and downright rude at times. It felt like they were doing us a favor by taking our orders and bringing us our subpar meals.To top it all off, when I politely voiced my concerns to the server, he brushed me off and made me feel like an inconvenience. It's clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority here.In summary, L'Ardente in Washington DC is a place I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. Terrible ambiance, lackluster food, and abysmal service make this a dining experience to avoid at all costs. Save your money and go somewhere else where you can actually enjoy your meal.";MD, MD;0;1;1624;287;1;0
L'Ardente;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/l-ardente-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Charles F.;1;8/19/2023;"I was utterly disappointed by my experience at L'Ardente. Despite its lavish description, the reality fell flat. The glittering chandeliers and gold-plated pizza oven couldn't mask the lackluster food and overpriced menu. The so-called ""impeccable ingredients"" seemed to be missing in my dishes. The supposed glorious contrasts of Italy were more like a confusing mishmash of styles that left me unsatisfied. It's clear that the restaurant's concept doesn't live up to its hype, making it a regrettable dining choice. The service was also not the best he made our family feel awkward. I believe his name was Hector STAY AWAY from this server!";Washington, DC;0;1;642;103;1;0

The so-called award-winning 40-layer lasagna was just a bunch of horizontal layers, not vertical, so you could only taste a few layers in one bite. And it was nothing special, just ordinary. The linguine wasn't cooked well at all. The tiramisu was a disaster. The rum and passion fruit totally overpowered the tiramisu flavor. But hey, the risotto was amazing! I'd go back just for that dish.;Washington, DC;25;10;420;73;1;0

It was called award-winning, but it was just a bunch of horizontal layers, so you could only taste a few layers at a time. It was pretty average, nothing special.

When I go out and want to spend money on food, this is not the place to go. My pasta ended up being dry with little to no sauce and the portions my partner had for his lobster pasta was extremely small. It was barely a portion and completely not worth the price. The chocolate cake they have on their dessert menu did not taste like anything special either. There are plenty of other places to get food that look just as nice. I recommend that you try elsewhere.;Silver Spring, MD;0;6;568;108;0;1

However, I was left disappointed with my dining experience.While the ambiance was fantastic and the service was excellent, the food was a major letdown. I was expecting high-quality dishes that would live up to the restaurant's reputation, but instead, I was served food that was subpar for a top-rated establishment in the area.I tried several items from the menu and was underwhelmed by the flavors. The ingredients used were of good quality, but the dishes lacked that extra special touch that I was expecting. I was hoping for a memorable dining experience, but unfortunately, that was not the case.Overall, I was disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. While the ambiance and service were both excellent, the food simply did not live up to the hype. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a top-notch dining experience in the DC area.;Fort Lauderdale, FL;0;5;984;163;0;1

L'Ardente;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/l-ardente-washington?not_recommended_start=10;Katherine C.;4;09/05/2024;L'Ardente apparently is difficult to score a reservation for but thankfully when I signed up for notification for an opening I was able to get one. The atmosphere is very nice and as a tourist the area felt nice as well. The hostess staff were friendly which is always a plus. I forget who my server was but she was a bit awkward and hard to spot at certain times but was friendly so not a serious issue, just could have been better for a more upscale restaurant. We got a caesar salad, pepperoni pizza, lasagna, and the carbonara for two which was way too much food for two people (we knew that going into it). The caesar salad was good and the pepperoni pizza was thin crust and very oily but good. I wish we hadn't gotten the pizza only so we could enjoy the pastas more. The lasagna here is expensive but a must get and probably their best dish. It's much more decadent than a regular lasagna and has short rib and some red wine(?) tomato sauce which is insanely good. The carbonara was good but hard to eat because we were so full from the pizza.Is it the best italian food I have ever had? Probably not, but the lasagna is worth trying. It's a nice restaurant if that's what you're looking for but the service and overall atmosphere aren't nearly as nice as you would expect. If I were to come back to DC I don't think this would be a place I would return to but I did enjoy it.;North End, Boston, MA;14;129;1384;266;1;238

L'Ardente;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/l-ardente-washington?not_recommended_start=10;Sana S.;4;4/14/2024;My friends and I visited Lardente for dinner, attracted by its inviting ambiance and stylish bar area. However, due to the crowdedness, we were seated in a less visually appealing back hall. We started with the fuchsia bread, which had excellent taste but required some effort to cut due to its thickness. The Arancini was a hit with its delightful flavors. As for the mains, the Cacio e Pepe stood out for its exceptional taste, while the 40-layer lasagna and pesto pasta lacked the desired temperature, impacting our enjoyment. For desserts, the Tiramisu FlambÃ© and Gianduja S'mores not only impressed in presentation but also in flavor. Moreover, the service was outstanding. The staff was sweet, attentive, and treated us really well. They also provided excellent suggestions on the menu and wine selection based on our preferences.

The dishes served here are flavorful and satisfying, making each bite a delight.

L'Ardente;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/l-ardente-washington?not_recommended_start=50;Bryant G.;5;11/10/2023;L'Ardente is consistently one of my favorite restaurants to visit. I am a regular patron, enjoying their delicious dishes at least three times a month. My go-to dish is the branzino, which is elevated by the complementary lemon sauce when dining in. The 40 layer lasagna is a standout, with rich flavors. The veal portion is large and best shared with a friend. Surprisingly, the cesare salad is a must-try. The drinks are always expertly crafted, with St. Clair's espresso martini being a standout. I have never experienced anything less than exceptional service during my visits. Whether I'm enjoying brunch or dining in the evening, the ambiance is always on point. L'Ardente has earned a solid 5-star rating from me every time I've dined in or ordered takeout. I even celebrated my birthday here earlier this year, and it was a memorable experience.;Washington, DC;4;27;853;143;1;116
L'Ardente;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/l-ardente-washington?not_recommended_start=50;Sabrina A.;5;11/02/2023;I recently had the pleasure of dining at L'Ardente and I can confidently say it was a culinary experience like no other. From the moment I walked in, I was captivated by the warm and inviting ambiance, setting the stage for an unforgettable evening! APP - Duck Ravoli. This is the best little bite you'll ever have. The dish comes prepared in 4 bite sized servings. The creamy truffle sauce melts in your mouth. I wish they made this as a main entree because it's just that good.  MAIN - 40 layer lasagne. This plate left me in awe. The combination of ingredients and the expert preparation showcased the chef's culinary art. The sauce is perfectly balanced with the beef ragu that is just so tender. Easily some of the best lasagne you'll have.  DESSERT - Cheescake (not pictured). The riscotta cheesecake with berry finish and almond crumbs was the perfect blend of sweet and tarty to end the night. The service here is impeccable. The staff was attentive without being intrusive, and their knowledge of the menu and wine pairings was impressive. They guided me through the selections, enhancing the overall dining experience.Highly recommend a visit for a date night or special occasion dinner;Arlington, VA;0;1;1198;205;0;3

Stop channeling your inner Alex P. Keaton and pay attention to not just the typical white upper middle class ""rich"" patrons. Remember that all walks of life deserve respect and you shouldn't judge based on your limited and narrow life experiences. Stop insulting your own local museums just to be cool and fit in with those that think ""the arts"" are a waste of time. You look dumb and immature when you act like that. And unappreciative of the great city and the institution that pays you. If you want to be bullied, treated poorly, and told how the museums are useless around here, come in and sit at the bar!

Instead they delivered a table for maybe 15. Then a big circular table. They one gave us one waitress. One!!!!!! As you can see , she got highly overwhelmed. Then she became rude and annoyed by our questions. She forgot food orders, drinks, and utensils. Now that was my observation with the party, meanwhile she was very nice to me! I spoke clear and courteously to her. My drink was perfect and so was my dish! I understand how it feels to be on the other side of the table.

It was about 10am and the bartender was stocking. I told him that I would like something of a Bloody Mary or Michelada. He immediately told me, ""I am not a west coast gangster with tattoos..I don't make those."" I was in absolute shock. I got up and left. He still tried to come at me with words as though to try to prove his point but he simply kept digging his hole deeper with me. I spoke to a young lady which was the manager and when I told her of his unnecessary and bigot remarks, her jaw dropped. She profusely apologized and offered to have us be seated at a neighboring bar. I expressed how discontent and offended I was to have traveled to that city and be shunted in this manner. It was appalling. I simply wanted her to be aware that she is employing a bigot at her establishment and he is a reflection of the business. While she was talking with me, my husband passed the bar and heard the bartender speaking with another employee. He heard him say, ""I don't need this shit right now!"". He should have chosen his words more wisely. Why spend my money there when there are so many other beautiful, historical locations that represent the town and culture nicely.

Last year we went and both the food and service was stupendously fun and delicious. Yesterday, a party of six, we saw everyone around us getting served, but we waited nearly 45 minutes. Several times servers came by with large numbers of plates and tried to lay the wrong food down on the table. When we said no that's not ours, they just started turning in circles looking for the correct table. Then they walked off. I'm not sure if they ever found the correct tables. In the meantime when our food did come, 45 minutes later, it was tepid, the fish, trout, was not fresh. It tasted bland and oddly textured the way frozen fish often tastes. The salad greens were on the way towards being brown at the edges.  Our friends Eggs Benedict dish was cool and the eggs and sauce had congealed. If we had not been with a large group and on a schedule I would have sent it back and told me to bring a hamburger, because it is really hard to screw up a hamburger. I am really sorry to say this and I hope it was just one bad day, but it did put me off badly.;Alexandria, VA;4;7;1174;227;1;1

The crab dip has decent flavor. The oysters were very good (best part of the meal). Two of us had the parmesan crusted trout.

Johnny always takes care of us, the seafood is always fresh and everything else what you would expect from a Clyde's-owned establishment.Went in for brunch on a Saturday afternoon and right away were greeted by throngs of people at the door. It's the Ebbitt--pretty standard situation so we headed straight for the front bar. Immediately you could tell that their computers were down as you could see the manual credit card machines out and handwritten check on the bar. As a former server/bartender--this sucks. Still, the service was good and the bartenders and guests kept their cool.The two stars is for the food. We ordered the muffin sampler and it was just, eh. Six little muffins on the plate with some preserves thrown in the middle. Not awful but just not really good. Seemed like they came straight out of the microwave. For $6.95 I don't know what I expected.We both got the Eggs Chesapeake and both of us had eggs that were almost hard boiled. The crabcake was lukewarm and the hollandaise was almost non-existent. The potato gratin was again, eh. My potatoes seemed cooked, his didn't.With all of that being written, we won't stop going to the Ebbitt. We just won't go at brunch.;Washington, DC;0;5;1321;227;1;14

The energy was great and the hospitality of the host and waiter was excellent. The food on the other hand was just ok: I had the skirt steak (or something along those lines) and my friend had the duck. The steak was slightly tough even though I had asked for it medium rare, and the duck wasn't anything to write about (get it?)If you're looking for a fun place for a group, I would happily recommend this place, but if you're aiming for a menu that will dazzle your taste buds, I have a few other places I would rather suggest.;Los Angeles, CA;0;33;773;147;1;0

I went with my boyfriend for his birthday and another friend. Service was find but we all agreed the food was sub par. The meatloaf was very dry and the steak I ordered was way over cooked. The second time I went was about a year later and I sat at the bar and had appetizers. They were very tasty, which was a terrific surprise. The seafood tasted fresh and the mussels were done just right. The atmosphere at the bar was lively and entertaining and I was happy to have tried the place again.;Arlington, VA;0;19;600;114;0;0

Without a doubt, the food was deserving of a solid 5-star rating. The clam chowder, oyster, Nashville sandwich, and eggs Benedict were all incredibly delicious. The venue itself is stunning. However, the bathroom appears outdated and is located downstairs. While I was heading down, I noticed a gentleman struggling to navigate the stairs, likely due to an injury.We opted for black coffee, and although the initial serving was good, I finished it within 2 minutes. While various staff members passed by, attending to other tables and refilling water as needed, no one offered to replenish our coffee. After waiting for about 20 minutes and searching for our waiter for an additional 10 minutes, we decided to leave and find coffee elsewhere. Despite the minor inconveniences, the overall experience was almost perfect, but these few issues led us to rate it a 4-star instead of a 5-star.;Southwest Washington, Washington, DC;2;22;954;157;1;1

Initially I could only answer with a heavy sigh until He asked a third time and I responded, ""yes."" From that time forward the Lord promised that he would do a new thing (Isaiah 43:18-19). The Lord relocated us to a new state and we struggled through the pain together with the Lord as the three-fold cord that brought healing and newness of life to our relationship.

Those few female hostesses placed us, out-of-town tourists, all the way outside--actually all the way outside out of the restaurant in the back, while there're still seats available in the front of the main dining hall. Of course, the logic is clear: they'd rather keep the front with well-dressed people with jackets and business ties. But, hey, we pay the same price, if not even more because of our generous tips and big orders. In the end, we made a strong request for a better seating, and were eventually given a table inside the restaurant. Lobster cocktails and all seafood plates are strong recommended.

Old Ebbitt Grill;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/old-ebbitt-grill-washington?not_recommended_start=230;Christine H.;4;1/26/2018;This is definitely a DC staple, it is amazing how crowded it is even on odd times - and the staff is always hustling accommodating large groups, party of 1 at the bar - its impressive to watch. Extremely consistent and wait staff is always on their game. If you have a large group and don't want to risk a poor experience - this is where you go. Only deduction is there is nothing particularly interesting about the menu - at all, simplistic salads and traditional American. Again, this is your best bet for a go-to large group we have 14 people situation, but for a 4 and under crowd I'd go for somewhere a bit more interesting.;Columbus, OH;2;7;632;118;0;0

Our waiter was very pleasurable and warm, but lacking speed. I waited a whole 10 minutes for water refills while parched, really didn't appreciate that. The star entree of the night was the clam chowder, after I tried it I was convinced that the chefs back in the kitchen were real professionals.

My bf ordered the Skirt Steak and I had Chicken and Waffle. Okay so I regretted my decision the moment I tried the steak. The beef was a perfect rare, sooo tender and juicy with oven fried potato and spinach on the side. The steak sauce was wonderfully made from red wine and came great with the meat. I 100 percent recommend this dish. It was kinda disappointing that my chicken and waffle was a bit dried and salty. The price is very reasonable considering the restaurant's location and decoration.

My partner requested we go someplace he could get a bloody mary, and this place was the one that came up. Introducing: The Bloody Maryland, a delish bloody mary made with Old Bay Seasoning and topped with a jumbo shrimp. It was very good! The food, I had the Pit-Style Roast Beef. It wast tender and succulent with a great barbecue sauce. I could tell it was made in house. What cinched the sandwich for me was the fried onion on top! They were fried pieces of delight. A friend ordered the Southern Fried Porkchop! It was my favorite. I had the honor of trying a few bites! It was fried to perfection, paired with fried eggs and a gravy sauce. The cornbread was lightly sweet and grilled with the perfect amount of golden brown, you know there is flavor there! The potato salad is killer! I say that because well, I am not a fan of potato salad and there's won me over, so give it a whirl!This is a place to take a date, impress your colleagues, have some shooters after work, or watch powerful business transactions go down. It was calm during breakfast and LOUD and BUSY at night. It was great to step into a piece of this historic landmark, the new Old Ebbitt Grill.I enjoyed everything and I will be back.Keep up the good work.;Washington, DC;87;15;1343;247;1;4

Well I finally did for brunch service. The atmosphere is very nice, though perhaps dimly lit, and I can see how it could get loud in some areas, as tables are somewhat crammed together and can be a bit difficult to get in or out of. Honestly the server had little to no personality but was clearly knowledgeable and made great recommendations, though expensive ones. However, the prices were completely warranted as there was no question as to the portion size or quality of the product. It just goes to show that a quality product can sell itself, though if the service, in terms of personability, were higher this would be 5 stars hands down.

Old Ebbitt Grill;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/old-ebbitt-grill-washington?not_recommended_start=500;Chauncey G.;5;7/29/2024;Amid the storied streets of Washington DC, where whispers of the nation's past mingle with the footsteps of its present, Old Ebbitt Grill stands as a venerable bastion of culinary tradition. Here, amidst the shadows of grand monuments and the echoes of early American tales, I found myself dining alone, yet enveloped by the rich tapestry of history.Seated at the bar, an age-old refuge that seemed to pulsate with the heartbeats of the countless souls who had perched here before, I was greeted by the golden allure of a local pale ale. The beer, name as elusive as the fleeting whispers of yesteryear, was a delightful nod to the burgeoning craft of the capital's brewers.As I nursed the ale, my thoughts drifted to my absent companion, my wife, whose spirit seemed to hover in the air, tinged with the melancholy of temporary distance. It was in her imagined tastes and preferences that I found guidance through the extensive menu, a document as layered as the city itself. Prompted by the friendly bartender, whose familiarity with the offerings was as intimate as any old town crier's news, I selected an array of oysters--half Wellfleet, half Belle du jour, each a glistening testament to the ocean's bounty.These oysters, served raw on the half shell, seemed to carry the briny essence of the sea, each bite a direct line to the maritime journeys that once connected distant shores to the American table. As they slipped effortlessly down, I was momentarily transported to the raucous seafood markets that fed the capital's denizens in its infancy.Following the oysters, I indulged in a Faroe Island Salmon Salad, a vibrant mosaic of vegetables crowned with a piece of salmon so rich it could have graced any presidential table. Drizzled with herb-yogurt dressing and speckled with pomegranate molasses, each bite was a declaration of flavor independence, bold and unapologetic.To elevate the meal, a vintage 1988 French champagne lent its refined effervescence, echoing the celebratory toasts of diplomatic victories past. The lively bar, adorned with discreet Masonic symbols, hummed with an energy that seemed to reach back through decades, its patrons a modern-day assembly of the city's ever-evolving narrative.Old Ebbitt Grill, with its understated elegance and palpable history, offered not just a meal but a communion with the past. As I dined, the walls, imbued with secrets and stories, stood as silent guardians of all the whispered plots and bold proclamations that shaped the capital. This evening, though I was physically alone, I dined in the company of history's giants, their spirits as present as the taste of each meticulously prepared dish. Here, in the heart of Washington DC, the past is always seated at the table, generously sharing its enduring feast with all who enter.;Los Angeles, CA;7;105;2802;457;1;6

The restaurant itself has a really cool vibe, with old school lighting and a funky bar. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable, and the food is amazing.Everyone in our group loved the French toast and the crab cake. The Chesapeake eggs Benedict (with their signature crab cakes instead of ham) is the best. And if you just want to try it out, you can actually order a single crab cake as an appetizer, which isn't on the menu.;Washington, DC;17;16;640;118;1;0

I'm a mother of 3 kids,I lost my husband 2years ago. He left me and my kids with a lot of debts, student loans, medical bills, tax liens and evictions. The little business I was managing to help my family with was going down, so I called my sister who lives in North Carolina, she introduced me to this Credit Specialist. He did a wonderful job on my credit report. I was amazed when I saw how everything reflected on my profile perfectly. He wiped out the bad items off my report and also loaded my account with $18,000. I got a high score of 786 with a good credit limit. This is all I can say about him compared to other good reviews I read about him on the internet. I will also refer him to anyone out there who is in need of his services. Kindly contact him on REMOTE REPAIR at CLERK dot COM;Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada;0;26;893;172;0;0

From the moment we walked into this restaurant, the smells of delicious food awaiting, the absolutely stunning decor & the very iconic music playing throughout the restaurant, had me hooked.

Eric's attentiveness to our table, his impeccable kindness & his ability to be very efficient,, impressed us greatly. We only have a few more days in DC, but after tonight, we must go back at least one more time. Highly recommend checking out & please ask for Eric, he most definitely will not disappoint.

We always go to Todd and he's absolutely amazing, we have been going for years. The only thing I can say about this place is that they don't have a huge cocktail selection, and that they don't have red grapefruit juice, which I think that they should. They have that old-school yellow grapefruit juice that comes out of the can. Fresh juices would make a huge difference in drinks.;Alexandria, VA;0;7;717;133;1;0

From the oysters on half shells, clam casino, oyster Rockefeller, bacon cheese burger, salmon fillet, to bowl of chili I would come here over and over again for any meal of the day.

Decided to enjoy dinner here on October 27, 2015. Derrick was our waiter and he was beyond awesome!! In many restaurants, patrons are rushed through their meals so that tables can be turned quickly. We never felt this way at all! From the wonderful mussels in garlic and wine appetizer, to lobster entree, to the outstanding dessert (recommended by Derrick as one of the best among all the choices), it was all first class! I might add that when I asked for a glass of house chardonnay, Derrick's reply was ""buttery or crisp""? I replied,""buttery"", but my thought was ""yeah, right, we'll see about this.......well, the chardonnay was spot on!!!!Thank you Derrick, and Old Ebbitt Grill, for a memorable dining experience in DC!!!!!

Touted as the ""oldest saloon in Washington"", it has a decor that definitely reinforces how old the restaurant is (regardless of the fact that it has moved a few times over the many decades it has existed). It has some great art along the walls as well. I can only speak for the server I had, but he was incredibly generous, knowledgeable, funny, and there was never a moment where I was without drink. He was easily one of the best servers I've ever had, but I did not catch his name. Yes, it's a somewhat pricey restaurant, but it's well worth it.

Prices are good considering location, service and food (3mins walk from The White House). First of all food was delicious, did not have any problems there. Also with the amount of people there, the food only took about 15 minutes to come. The only thing i would have to say is that we ordered a burger without bacon and they gave it to us with bacon, however they made us a new one with our request and did not charge us for the dish! All in all, i highly recommend this restaurant.;Pickering, Canada;0;2;550;104;0;0

Let me start off by saying that I made a reservation 3 weeks prior to going bc we were coming in from CA for the 4th of July. So glad I did that! It was so mobbed you couldn't move in there. We got there about 15 minutes early and as busy as they were, we got seated by the time our reservation time came up. Our waiter was great but did try to upsell us on everything. Food was great. We had oysters (in July) which were really awesome, the chicken wings were so good, my husband had a GF pasta dish which was great, I had the crab cakes which were very good, my son had the Angel Hair with shrimp which he loved. My daughter had the buffalo chicken sandwich and she thought it was super good including the fries that came with it. So it was a great experience. Food was a little slow coming out bc it was a holiday but a great experience overall.;San Marcos, CA;176;8;913;180;1;0

Have eaten dinner there twice and ordered the same thing: single crabcake, which comes with a warm mustard potato salad and green beans. Best crabcake (and aioli) that I've ever eaten!!The place is always crowded, but both times the waitresses have been friendly and very efficient. They serve bread after you order (always nice) and water glasses have been refilled often on both of my visits. I've heard awesome things about the strip steak and rockfish (my friends raved about these), and good things about the sandwiches and burgers.Only negative: dessert could be better. My cappuccino brownie with ice cream would have been perfect if the brownie had been better, but it was pretty average. One friend also said the apple pie tasted store bought, which was disappointing.Overall - I highly recommend this place for dinner.

The Smith;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-smith-washington-2?not_recommended_start=0;Anabel F.;1;2/19/2024;Yesterday I had lunch at The Smith in Washington DC and unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. Upon being seated, it took an excruciating 15 minutes for our server to even approach our table to take our order. To add insult to injury, it then took an additional 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive.The true disappointment came when we requested more mustard, only to be informed by our server that they had run out and there were no more available in the restaurant. This response left me baffled, considering the brunch menu prominently featured Eggs Benedict, a dish that typically includes hollandaise sauce containing mustard. Refusing to accept this explanation, I approached one of the managers on the floor and was promptly provided with the mustard we had requested. It was evident that our server simply didn't want to be bothered with fulfilling our request initially.The overall service was abysmal, characterized by lethargy and negligence. Given the price tag of $24 for a burger at a restaurant of this caliber, one would expect impeccable service and at the very least, adequate condiments readily available. Unfortunately, The Smith fell far short of meeting these expectations, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth long after the meal had concluded.;San Francisco, CA;0;5;1281;209;0;0

They were out of their Chenin Blanc so the bartender brought me two tasters of similar wines, with his recommendation of the Gr¨¹ner. Chenin Blanc will now be taking a backseat from now on. I had their oysters of the day and ultimately had the Spicy Shrimp Scampi which was incredible, so flavorful. It took a lot of willpower to not return again before flying back home. Overall an amazing experience, highly recommend to anyone in the area.;Jacksonville, FL;0;4;608;106;0;0

The Smith;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-smith-washington-2?not_recommended_start=30;Robert S.;5;2/16/2024;Avocado toast is a popular and simple dish that features mashed or sliced avocado served over toasted bread. It has gained immense popularity recently due to its delicious taste, nutritional benefits and versatility, Avocado toast is typically made by toasting bread until it reaches your desired level of crispiness. Many people like to sprinkle salt, pepper, and sometimes other spices like red pepper flakes, chili powder, or lemon juice into their avocado for added flavour. I love the crispness of it.;Newton, MA;0;5;506;81;1;0

The stunning spectacle of a bar, complete with a striking wall of bottles, is an absolute feast for the eyes.My dining experience at The Smith was a gastronomic journey, featuring some of their standout dishes. The calamari was expertly prepared, while the Mac & Cheese was so good that it's my top recommendation for anyone visiting. But the star of the show, in my opinion, were the fish tacos - incredibly flavorful and easily the best I've ever had.I also tried the Squid Ink Tagliatelle and Roasted Salmon, both of which were excellent. Each dish was beautifully presented, and the flavor profiles were complex and satisfying.My dining experience was rounded off with a 'City Bird' mocktail. Despite being a tad pricier than I'd usually go for, its unique and refreshing flavor made it worth the indulgence.Overall, The Smith provides an unforgettable dining experience, combining an enticing menu, remarkable ambiance, and outstanding service. The Mac & Cheese alone is worth the visit, but the entire experience is one that shouldn't be missed. I can't wait to return for another spectacular meal.;Falls Church, VA;1;23;1249;204;1;25

The crispy roast pork tasted like they were deep-fried as the skin was almost too hard. The sauteed squid in XO sauce was fairly tasty even though the sauce was a tad too sweet. The ""squid"" tasted more like reconstituted rather than fresh. We initially ordered a sauteed spinach but the server recommended the snow pea shoot so we ordered that instead. The green leafy vegetable was a little overboiled and didn't have enough garlic so it was just salty with no other flavor. When we got the bill we were shocked that the snow pea shoots cost the same as the squid, $20.95. That's the most expensive plate of plain, simple, green veg with garlic I've had anywhere in the world.";Northwest Washington, Washington, DC;0;20;752;135;0;5

In anticipation, we got a buzzer, and walked down to Churchkey for a beer, and came back when the buzzer alerted us when our table was ready. I liked the convenience of being able to take that with us and grab a drink while we waited.Hostess asked us if we preferred our own table, or didn't mind sitting with another party. We chose the latter, and sat at a round table with another group of 2. The black tea/oolong tea wasn't as strong as i was used to, but still comforting. The carts moved throughout the space, and we were able to choose the items we wanted from the menu with relative ease. Crispy Pork with Hoisin, and the Shrimp Dumplings were our favorites! Many of the items here were delicious, and with a touch of soy sauce and hot chili oil, really set them over the edge. A miss on the menu was the chicken feet, but not just because they were chicken feet. I'm unsure of how they were cooked, but they were oversauced and didn't have a super enjoyable texture, and I was the only one to partake in eating them (about 1/3 of the portion). One small detractor I would mention is that sometimes the service staff who was pushing one of the specific carts, would get requests for something not specifically on their cart. For example, the employee running the steamed item cart spent 2-3 minutes trying to find a vegetable item for the other people at our table. It slowed the process down slightly, but otherwise the service staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. Overall, I enjoyed my experience and food. It was a first time at Dim Sum for one of my friends, and he said that the food ""opened up a new world and experience for brunch"" that he wanted to pass on to his friends!

In case anyone's wondering, the name means ""Big Red Robe"".  The service and front staff were helpful and friendly. Despite a line for dim sum, seating was pretty efficient with a buzzer system. The color photo and bilingual dim-sum ordering sheet with prices was a welcome upgrade from notepad style lists. Also we were quite impressed that the restaurant and bathrooms were very clean. Our group had a baby carriage, there's a baby changing station, and the staff were very accomodative with the table seating. They have round tables, too.Now for the food. If you're a true dim sum connoisseur it won't be the best you've ever had, but it's still very good and certainly fills the bill. You can find better dim sum in the DC suburbs in terms of taste, ingredients, and value. For example the sticky rice in bamboo leaves was fragrant, but lacked a lot of tasty ingredients that other dimsum restaurants have, and not much filling either. Many items at this restaurant are priced outlandishly high, even higher than most similar New York restaurants, presenting a value problem here. Gratuity was not automatically added, and the service was really very attentive so they certainly deserve credit for that.";Herndon, VA;243;83;1255;210;1;2

They charge $4 for tea. 2. The large dim sum dishes (1/3 of the menu) are only served after 11am, so if you're coming at open (10am) to beat the lines you have to skip with the dishes. 3.

Each dish we tried was bursting with authentic flavors and expertly crafted using traditional Thai techniques. I absolutely was mind-blown by the Khao soi g¨¤i (Egg noodles, chicken thigh, pickled cabbage, scallions, red onion, and northern Thai chili paste). My coworker had a beef soup that came with garlic rice that was also a delicious stand out. We couldn't get over how every bite was better than the last.Adding to the exceptional experience is the professional and attentive staff, who elevate the dining experience with their impeccable service and genuine hospitality.

As she distributed them she dropped a glass of red wine down my entire left arm. Luckily I had my napkin on my lap so it saved my pants. The other staff member told me they would pay to dry clean my white dress shirt. Not sure they understand what a red wine stain does to a white shirt. The manager was then called over and offered to give me a restaurant T-shirt to wear as I was soaked. He gives me his card and offers to dry clean or replace the shirt. He disappeared for 15 minutes with a 3XL and another shirt. I go to the men's room and the smaller shirt is to small. I put back on my wet and stained dress shirt. I never see the manger again. We eat our meals and ask to settle up. The waiter who took over for the waitress says he will speak to the manger. I ask to speak to him as well. The waiter comes back and no manager but he thinks the meal is free. At this point I've had enough and we leave. I look for the manger on the way out but no sign of him.Thanks to the waiter who took over a bad situation. You are to be commended. The rest of the staff including the manger are lacking to say the least.;Medfield, Medfield, MA;8;1;1440;290;0;0

I switched purses and realized when we entered that I didn't have my ID in my cute little purse for outings. At the bar the bar tender had to be flagged down after sitting for quite some time. When taking orders and he got to mine he asked for ID. I had my business credit card which someone under 21 wouldn't have. He wouldn't accept that, which was fine that he was sticking with the rules even though I'm almost 40 so clearly not underage. Problem was as we decided to leave to get me to my other bag so we could enjoy our night he looked annoyed. As we walked away, he shouted ""Gotta have your id ma'am,"" for the whole bar to hear. Scolding me like I'm some child. It was completely unnecessary. I've never been so embarrassed over something so ridiculous. I had actually had a really great dinner here in the past, but due to this experience I won't be back. Thanks tall blondish jerk of a bar tender.";Washington, DC;0;9;956;182;0;0

Unfortunately after being sat it was a downhill experience from there. We order bottle of wine from our server Javier. When he approached the table he seemed a little drunk but i wasnt to sure. After 15 minutes goes by we remind him about the bottle of wine. He ask which was was it again and we told him. After 10 minutes he comes back to get our order still no bottle of wine. We order apps and entrees and continue to wait. After 10 more minutes goes by there are still no apps or wine. We hear the table behind us complain that the same server has lost one of thier credit cards and after another 10 minutes we decide its not worth it and decide to leave. I have been to the Hamilton before but I have only sat at the bar and after such a horrible experience Im not sure if I will ever come back.

After walking around town to see the holiday tree displays, our group of 10 arrived for an 8:30 reservation. The lobby area was quite full, with no seating, and the adjacent bar area was packed to capacity. So loiter in the lobby we did. After 10 minutes we inquired and were told they're sorry, running behind. After 15 minutes, the same. After 20 we were told the party at the table they were going to seat us at were staying beyond their expected time and there was nothing they could do. Meanwhile, we had lost 3 people who were just too hungry to wait while two adjacent 4-top tables sat empty for at least 15 minutes past our group shrinking down to 8. At 8:55 we called The Elephant and Castle a short distance away and were told we could be seated right away. We left and were glad we did. The host and hostess working on 12/18/2012 could not have cared less. NO ONE IN OUR GROUP OF 10 WILL RETURN. EVER. Have I mentioned that reservations were made 3 weeks prior and required a firm head count and a credit card to hold the reservation--we were told we'd be charged for no shows. I would have loved for The Hamilton to hold their customers in as high regard as they hold themselves. ASTOUNDINGLY TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.;Olney, MD;0;3;1294;241;0;1

Then tried to use it at the Shell station on Benning Road where he was declined (I canceled my card). Another coward with no soul. The manager said he had the entire incident on security camera but the quality was not good so neither he nor the responding police officer could get a clear description beyond a ""black guy in a grey hat"".

The moment I stepped inside, I was greeted by a beautifully decorated space that exuded elegance and sophistication. The attention to detail in the decor was remarkable, with tasteful lighting, stylish furniture, and an overall cozy atmosphere.However, despite the impressive aesthetics, I found the food to be quite mediocre. While the menu offered a variety of options, the taste and quality of the dishes did not live up to the expectations set by the restaurant's ambiance. The flavors were lacking depth, and some dishes were even underseasoned. It was disappointing to see such a disconnect between the visual appeal of the restaurant and the taste of the food.The waitstaff was not very attentive and kind of condescending, which was really odd.

To clarify my review, I had the choice of making the Jumbo Crab Cake into a sandwhich or just by itself. Of course, who eats a $19 crabcake by itself - I chose the option to make the dish into a sandwhich for the same cost. The menu quotes, ""make it a sandwhich with fries and coleslaw $19."" I also got a miso soup which was not even close to what a miso soup should taste like.A few days ago, I wrote a review about how a burgers' proportions should fit their price. I tried avoiding burgers since then. When I received my order, I knew that there was going to be a yelp review posted that night. I received another low quality burger as a meal - of course when asked how the meal was, I said ""its good."" This white, fake a** burger, looked like its buns were from Giants and was fresh out of the plastic. The buns from Big Mac is much more moist and orginal than this one. Aside from being called a ""sandwhich,"" the coleslaw side was actually inside the burger - a disgusting combination. The burger was about 4 and a half inches high - Impossible to bite. I had to use a fork, knife, and spoon to eat this burger. On the other hand, the burger consisted of welldone ingredients such as: A NON JUMBO crabcake, fresh lettuce, tomato, fresh out of the plastic bun, and coleslaw. My second order was a miso soup. For sushi lovers out there and miso soup specialists, understand that this miso soup will not taste like any miso soup that you have tasted before. The contents of the soup included: mushroom, Mushroom, and mushrooms. I could not taste nor smell anything else other than it's freshly moist, soft, and tender mushrooms. The tofu was well prepared, soft and well portioned. The scallions were fresh and the salt was somewhat enough. When buying crabcakes, I recommend Conrads Crab Seafood Market Towson, Maryland. The best miso soup so far for me is located at: Yama sushi Bar Baltimore, Maryland.";Catonsville, MD;56;4;2041;374;1;5

The spicy tuna roll had a nice kick to it and the firecracker roll was very good.We left here full and had a good time, unsure if they offered dessert since we didn't see a menu but it is worth a stop here.;Alexandria, VA;7;42;941;180;1;17

The sushi was fresh and delicious as always, I had the Firecracker and the Dynamite rolls. My salad was equally as good, I had the Spicy Grilled Chix salad. My friend had the open-faced bbq brisket sandwich, which needed a little something but it was good. Overall the experience was great because of the service!

From the moment I walked in, I was captivated by the vibrant and welcoming atmosphere. The ambiance is a perfect blend of modern elegance and classic charm, making it an ideal spot for a delightful evening out.Now, let's talk about the food. I ordered the steak, and it was absolutely phenomenal! Cooked to perfection, it was tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor. The parmesan fries that accompanied the steak were equally impressive - crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and generously dusted with parmesan. They were the perfect complement to the steak, creating a harmonious and satisfying meal.And then there was the Oreo shake. Oh my goodness, it was pure bliss in a glass! Creamy, rich, and perfectly sweet, it brought back nostalgic memories of childhood treats but elevated to a gourmet level. It was the ideal way to cap off an incredible meal.The Hamilton is truly a gem in the heart of Washington, D.C.

The Hamilton;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-hamilton-washington?not_recommended_start=90;James W.;5;12/05/2023;Owned by Clyde's restaurant group (who also owns Clyde's and Old Ebbit Grill), this is an exceptional place to dine.With elegant and sophisticated rooms, professional dining staff, cool decor, two bars, and a music venue underground, it offers a lot.While Old Ebbit Grill has happy hour oysters, The Hamilton has Happy Hour Sushi, where they take $5 off the sushi prices from 2-5 PM or 10 PM - 1 AM. Since we visited outside of happy hours, we tried the Queen Trident Roll, which is the only roll ineligible for the discount.FOOD: The menu is virtually the same between all the restaurant groups, except The Hamilton is known for their sushi, has more steak options, and fish. For these reasons, I would say this is probably one of the better restaurants owned by Clyde's since they have more options.DESSERT: Once more, The Hamilton offers another unique experience, since they have boozy and regular milkshakes. However, one can also order one to drink during the meal as well (although it's not on the regular menu). The milkshakes are delicious and not massive, so I would recommend each person order their own.;Washington, DC;7;162;1115;190;1;1072

The Hamilton;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-hamilton-washington?not_recommended_start=140;Andy H.;5;09/03/2014;THIS IS THE COOLEST RESTAURANT IN DC. Its open late, the food is phenomenal, there is a live music venue in the basement, free live music upstairs in the loft bar on the weekends, and 1/2 price sushi from 3-6 daily! Hands down my favorite place to get dinner, grab a drink, or checkout some live music. This place has it all. First off the place is absolutely gorgeous. No expense appears to have been spared when it comes to the decor. This place is also massive. I believe my very knowledgeable server (Felipe) told me it is about 37,000 square feet and can house about 1000 people on its three floors at any given time. The basement of this place is in my opinion DC's coolest most intimate music venue. I love going to concerts hear. I got to see some of my favorite acts like Darkstar Orchestra, Karl Denson's Tiny Universe, Leftover Salmon, Bonerama, and John K Band. The sound and lighting system is incredible and they book great acts. On top of that they serve world class sushi and gourmet pizza. Where else can you see a kick ass concert and eat some fresh Boston Bluefin tuna while sipping on some local craft brews. Now that's just the downstairs. Upstairs is a whole different animal. There are two beautiful wood bars. That are open till 3! The food upstairs includes a full sushi bar with some of DC's best sushi and a wide range of innovative local and seasonal offerings including steaks, seafood, pastas and burgers. Best wings in DC too. They have the most delicious sweet and spicy mumbo sauce. For desert try the chocolate gooey cake. This place is open late, so if you need some drunkchies late night they serve food till 1 or 2 am. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone.........seriously check this place out.;Washington, DC;310;9;1748;315;1;1

The Hamilton;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-hamilton-washington?not_recommended_start=150;Bo P.;5;04/02/2014;I don't like vegetables. So how is it that I have come to rely on the Brussels Sprouts and Kale salad as my go-to order every time I get to the Hamilton? It's just that good, and for you naysayers, no it's not dressed up to taste like something different. The veggies are fresh and the dressing is very light, but pairs perfectly with the salad.But, not liking vegetable is not a problem when there is a pulled pork and mac and cheese sandwich with cole slaw on Texas Toast on the menu! The menu is creative and fresh, and there are several things for everyone--not just something for everyone.I visit the Hamilton every chance I get when I'm in DC. The atmosphere is gorgeous, and while it is loud at happy hour, the buzz just adds to the energy of the place.Attentive service is the norm;;;;;;;

I haven't had anything at this place that is of poor quality. Everything is top-notch all the way and the food does not disappoint. The ingredients used are uncommon from most other places and typically do not taste well mixed together, however the Hamilton does this with perfection. Everything from the LTD tators to the crab cakes are made with care. I still haven't made it past the first floor, but I'm good with my laziness.

The Hamilton;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-hamilton-washington?not_recommended_start=160;Paul M.;5;12/22/2011;I stopped here for dinner last night after hearing some positive early reviews from friends. My wife and I were seated in the back dining room, which involved walking through no less than two major dining rooms and down a hallway that brought to mind the Victorian splendor of the National Arboretum, pre-modernization. Our room was absurdly spacious and oddly attractive, the decor somehow successfully pulling together brainy mid-century abstract bronze sculpture, contemporary painting, Federalist woodwork and Victorian lighting. The menu was equally ambitious and eclectic, with a full range of charcuterie, cheeses, salads, seafood dishes, meats, pastas, sandwiches and, most curiously, sushi. I am always sceptical when I see a wide range of food on a menu and was too scared to sample the latter. My wife took a flyer on the Salmon Lover roll though, which was inspired with roasted tomato inside and topped with slices of kiwi. They are obviously taking the sushi thing seriously, going for a fusiony, upscale style that I look forward to sampling next time around. For an appetizer I had the charcuterie: fennel salami, sopresseta and mocetta... all outstanding. For dinner, the Nantucket Bay scallops and my wife had the crab cakes, which we ate to the last crumb. Too full for dessert, but I look forward to trying the cinnamon bun pudding next time. The only weak link was the service... we had a nice waiter, but he was clearly a little overwhelmed by a full house on the second night of opening. All restaurants take some time to get sorted, and this place is the size of Union Station, so expect a learning curve in the beginning. We will wait a couple weeks for them to smooth the kinks out, but we'll definitely be back.;Washington, DC;0;5;1738;295;0;0

ANJU;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/anju-washington?not_recommended_start=10;Noha A.;5;6/26/2022;Friends have been recommending ANJU so we figured we'd give it a go. We went on a weeknight with a reservation and were seated outside. We ordered the beyond meat dumplings and they were so good! I couldn't believe there wasn't any meat in them! Really well spiced with a chili sauce on top. For mains, our waiter was really helpful navigating the menu. He recommended the Palace Ddukbokgi and we decided to order the Jjamppong since we were in the mood for seafood. Personally, I liked the spiciness of the Jjamppong more than the Ddukbokgi, but both were very good. The entrees have large portions and we had more than enough food. Can't wait to come back and try more of the dishes (and save space for the fish waffle) soon!;Washington, DC;345;113;735;132;1;12

The chicken the chicken the chicken!!! That's all I'm gonna say.

Hostess doesn't stand at the host stand. She sits at the long table BEHIND a column (behind the host stand) with her iPods in her ears.

I noticed they were a little busy, I asked the host if I could order for take out, she said yes. I made my order and waited in the lobby. When the food came out she was on the phone with a customer. However, when she got off the phone she was talking and laughing with the other workers and never checked on my food order even 15 minutes later. I tried to walk near the front without seeming rude that I was waiting for the food. I stood there and stood there and she wouldn't go check if the food was mine, I was the only customer waiting for a take out. My food was sitting there and I was starring at it getting cold for 10 minutes. I should have politely asked if it was mine, but I didn't want to seem pushy, because I worked in customer service before and I always appreciated patient customers. I almost feel like she was purposely making me wait. Finally I asked one of the other hosts to check, and sure enough the take out package I starred at for ten minutes in front of all the hosts at the front was mine. Yes the food was cold obviously by then and I was mostly just disappointed because I had a long day and I was not rude to anyone, I don't feel like returning.;Vienna, VA;1;28;1283;251;1;18

We stayed for a cocktail. Not sure of the two bartenders names who were working but what I am sure about is they have horrible customer service skills, they don't smile and they are often times arrogant especially the male.. I think he said his name was Jevon but his arrogance is borderline sexual harassment. Our drinks finally came which were way to strong, unbalanced and not what we asked for. We discussed this with the bartender who commented in a very unprofessional manner never once apologizing or offering to remake the drink. My girlfriends and I found him to be repulsing and we decided to leave. We ended up going to one of Renee's favorite locations she told us about for great Indian food and scrumptious cocktails Don't get me wrong we love the food at Bus Boys but our experience will never be the same and that's what keeps many diners like us coming back to their favorite restaurants 1) Service 2) Experience 3) Atmosphere Renee has a gift of making you feel important, thought of and appreciated.

She made us laugh and she made us feel like we were at home having dinner with great friends and it was just the two of us During the course of our meal we never had to ask for anything because she was always checking on us cleaning as she went My wife and I host events and we inquired with Renee if she would be interested in working at one of our events because she is fantastic and our clientele would enjoy her presence and service One evening I brought a few of my clientele to Bus Boys and Poets for Open Mic Night and it was insanely busy. Renee was working behind the bar...multi-tasking like I've never seen it done before. She can take not just your order but orders of other guests while making drinks for guests at the bar and for the staff while cracking jokes making people laugh The joy of meeting her and enjoying her service again was shattered when we walked in Sunday evening and was informed she no longer worked there We have seen many staff come and go as often as as fast as people change their clothes and their thoughts Leaving us to question what is going on with this location for them to loose or get rid of some great employee's?

The taste was certainly a positive, but consistency across locations is key for me, especially as a frequent diner. It would be great to see more attention given to delivering the same level of quality and value at all branches.

I loved the ambiance from the moment we walked up. There were several patrons eating inside and outside plus several parties waiting. I joined the waitlist on Yelp, and upon checking in, the host was very nice and helpful and let me know that she would move me to the priority list. I waited about 20 minutes for a table, if that. You know when you're hungry time seems to move much slower than it actually is. While waiting, I witnessed something very disturbing from another guest. They were dining solo with their four legged friend, which is cool. However, the next time I looked, this guest gave their dog a plate from the restaurant and the dog ate off the plate!!! Very unsanitary and I'm not sure if staff noticed this act. The staff worked diligently to get parties seated as quickly as possible. All hands were on deck turning and seating tables. We got our food and it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either, just regular. I ordered a chorizo chicken hash and I thought it was supposed to come in a skillet (I was not trying to chance getting the same plate the dog ate off of) and the other individual in my party had the smoked salmon Benedict. $6 mimosa was great! Also the orange juice was fresh and delicious. Probably the greatest thing about our meal. Overall, I loved the ambiance and the food was ok. Staff was helpful and friendly.

I ve been here a few times and got caught in some sort of hip hop night. Within an hour the cliente completely changed from business men to hip hop star wannabe's. However even on that visit the food was delicious. I believe the only issue I ve had was the wait service. The three times I have went, I do not believe they have noticed I was there. The food and atmosphere make up for the lack of service. The menu is one of those ""ahhh I don't think I'm going to like anything..."" to ""Wow that sounded horrible but was excellant.""

I'm a mother of 3 kids,I lost my husband 2years ago. He left me and my kids with a lot of debts, student loans, medical bills, tax liens and evictions. The little business I was managing to help my family with was going down, so I called my sister who lives in North Carolina, she introduced me to this Credit Specialist. He did a wonderful job on my credit report. I was amazed when I saw how everything reflected on my profile perfectly. He wiped out the bad items off my report and also loaded my account with $18,000. I got a high score of 786 with a good credit limit. This is all I can say about him compared to other good reviews I read about him on the internet. I will also refer him to anyone out there who is in need of his services. Kindly contact him on REMOTE REPAIR at CLERK dot COM;Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada;0;26;893;172;0;0

This was my first time at the 5th street location, and the minute you walk in it feels very D.C. I came alone with my computer to do some work, but before being seated, checked out the cute bookstore at the entrance. I ended up buying ""The Other Wes Moore"" (great read) before finding a seat on a comfy couch near the entrance, close to an outlet. The food is amazing for us vegan-starved-extroverts. So hard finding GOOD vegan food in this city, but Busboys delivered. I got the coconut tofu bites that comes with a sweet sauce and ordered a harira soup - a hearty Moroccan bean soup that was pretty excellent. Ended up staying there for about 3 hours doing work and left very happy. Hoping to check out the 14th & V location next!";Washington, DC;0;13;782;146;1;0

After trying most of the menu items I really like their falaffel sandwich as well as the various paninis. Its a pretty happening place, great to sit around the bar and eat your food and people watch. In the summer I opt for their outdoor seating which is really nice. Their staff and service is top notch, particularly their bartenders who really go out of their way to make sure you enjoying your meal. They also have a great list of vegan options which is sometimes hard to find in the city. Definately recommend this place.;Washington, DC;0;4;587;109;0;0

We discovered an utterly disturbing libation offered, named ""Ernest Goes To Wakanda."" My comrade and myself walked out immediately, however, my other comrade decided to do a further investigation about this blasphemous shit! According to the white supremacy bartender, ""Well, this was actually created by a black bartender"", as if this justified this degenerate ass foolishness! Although, I have not embraced in the ""Black Panther Movie"" for my own personal reasoning, I am a appalled that a black staff member allegedly manifested this within a predominantly white establishment! Not to mention all of the ""Earnest Goes To...(fill in the black)...movies are highly ignorant and racist. There is even an ""Earnest Goes to Africa"" movie.

The smells emanating from here were incredible, so we decided to wait some 15 minutes in a nice area they had where you're only served drinks. Once we finally had the chance to order, I didn't hesitate to go for the bald-sounding smoked Cornish hen with some duck drumettes for apps. To be honest the drumettes were better than the hen, they had a specific savory/scrumptious combination that I've never tried before, I loved it. The Cornish hen was a little bland. The waitress was trying very hard to keep up with our orders so we decided to leave a considerable tip in the end. She was falling behind a little timewise but I'm pretty sure that there wasn't ONE empty table while we were in there, so hats off to her for the effort.;Northwest Washington, Washington, DC;0;1;881;162;0;0

Not great, but good. I had the goat sausage. It was a bit overcooked but still interesting. The veggies with smoked yogurt and such were good too. The atmosphere was relaxing for an evening dinner with friends, but it was a little bit too dark and hard to read the menu! We were seated in a corner and there was a weird smell that they were trying to cover with coffee beans in a jar, which half worked but not totally. I get it, it's an older building ect but they should deal with that. But it wasn't unbearable and didn't ruin the evening. The duck was good too. We tried that. The goat cheese fondue and bread were good, unusual but good but they needed to give more bread. So we used the cheese on our veggies. Drinks were a mixed bag. We tried a bunch. Some were excellent - lemon char, bourbon drinks. Others were blah. A couple we order sounded awesome on the drinks menu with all sorts of flavors and herbs promised but when we got the drinks it was like, did they leave out this and that because I can't even taste xyz. I suppose that was a specific bartender though so maybe better next time. Still overall I'd go back sometime and would recommend to at least try it maybe.;Washington, DC;0;5;1231;236;0;1

Estadio;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/estadio-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Jennifer H.;1;11/04/2011;DAMN!! Estadio has ENORMOUS potential. It is fabulous in every other way (except that it's a little too noisy), but they serve foie gras and veal!! REALLY?? Why/how could any chef nowadays serve these grotesque animal products? Do the research!! They are horrifically raised, treated and slaughtered just so a bunch of foodies can experience a fleeting moment of gastronomic delight. Imagine the pain and suffering the animal felt their entire lives just so a chef can feel trendy and a patron can feel a moment of pleasure. It's disappointing that in a socially aware, liberal-leaning, neighborhood of D.C. that there are not more enlightened chefs. I hope other patrons speak up for the ducks and calves who are force fed, immobilized, and tortured their entire lives just to be brutally slaughtered. When you eat foie gras or veal you're eating fear, sickness, disease, and suffering. Is it really worth it? I hope Estadio wakes up and says no.;Washington, DC;0;3;947;159;1;0

Decor and Layout is different for the area and interesting. The large windows and corner location make it ideal to people watch. The meals are fine. Order many plats otherwise you will leave hungry. The drinks are fine. Nothing extraordinary. The Service is fine. In defense of the waiters however, the restaurant was busy and they have been understaffed. The wait for a seat was over an hour. I was not able to make reservations for a party of 2. The restaurant is overpriced. Finally, the place is great for gathering of friends to grab a drink and something small to nosh.

Since I am not a huge fan of Jaleo or La Tasca I was hoping to find a favorite DC tapas restaurant. Alas, I did not. The food was good but nothing to rave about. My Tortilla Espanola was dry and let's face it, this is a staple dish that should be perfect. The drinks were also a let down.

Estadio;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/estadio-washington?not_recommended_start=10;David N.;3;10/01/2011;I wish I could understand the appeal of this place. Crowded it is. So if that is your criteria, sardine yourself in and join the crowd. It's a tapas place, which in theory is great. Casual and relaxed. Here's my beef... or jamon as they say at Estadio. Don't go hungry because you have to order five orders of tapas for two people. So the low price per plate adds up to an expensive meal. This place is not for me but I must tell you that they are doing something right because the place is always busy. Go figure...;Washington, DC;0;6;516;100;1;1

They had some sort of orange thyme gin and tonic -- AMAZING! The only dish we didn't love was the shrimp, it was just okay at best. Also, the space between the bar and the seats against the wall was a little cramped and it made it difficult to cross your legs as people were passing by.

But if you order something like Mussels or the cured meats, those dishes come with bread, but they don't tell you they come with bread. So we ordered some bread specifically to dip into the mussels sauce only to find that the mussels and the meats come with their own bread. So we ended up with a table full of bread! So come on... just give us the bread for free, or at least tell us that many of the dishes we ordered come with bread so we don't need to order more of it, and you'd have an easy 5 star review!;Washington, DC;60;80;865;165;1;0

We had to wait 30 minutes for our table but it was well worth it. We had a fantastic bourbon infused ""slushito"" (a slurpee with booze) while we waited and that was a perfect way to start off. The restaurant is gorgeous and makes you feel like you are in Barcelona, not Logan Circle. I can honestly say that the Patatas Bravas and Spanish tortilla were better then any I experienced during my 5 visits to Spain.

The lounge area is where my friend and I ended up sitting. We both ordered from the bar and our drinks were brought immediately, which was nice. I also like the fact that they bring you a pitcher like thing filled with water so you don't have to wait for refills as the water glasses were on the small side. The food was so-so. I had the blackened chicken sandwich and it was okay, the chicken was juicy but it wasn't as spicy as I would have expected.

This place used to be some latin/asian fusion place, but it sucked. The commissary is by the same owners and it is a good fit for the neighborhood. It is sad that the food is not as good as logan, but at least they have a different menu. I gave this four starts, even though I dont like it as much as logan, but the service is consistent, the food is consistent, etc. It is laid back, etc. They serve breakfast all day whihc is a HUGE plus because therereally are not a lot of breakfast places in the area. Whole foods, but I have been eating their same food for 10 years now. Anyway, this is a good place with free wifi and simple american fare food.;Washington, DC;0;5;757;146;0;0

Commissary;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/commissary-washington?not_recommended_start=70;Sean B.;5;2/14/2011;"This has become my go-to restaurant in the Logan Circle area. Yesterday was the first time I've gone when it was super packed, and I was quite impressed by the host remembering people's names and how quickly we were served. I also thanked the heavens that Commissary was one place that actually knows what ""medium rare"" means. On the other hand, its mac 'n cheese? Bland city. Skip it. Well, unless you like eating tasteless, fatty food. Big disappointment. But since that is the only dish I haven't enjoyed here, I have to give Commissary 5 stars for its value, above average food, and efficient service.";Oakland, CA;125;1166;606;106;1;76

This place is very inexpensive and I question the why some other reviewers feel the need to badmouth the place. I mean, its not the inn at little Washington, but they don't pretend to be either. whats an entree here? 12 bucks? Gimme a break! They are what they are, somewhere between a diner and a casual restaurant where you can eat and not go broke over it. and the food is good. Ive had to wait for a table on occasion, but that's because they are always busy. On the one time I had an issue with my food taking a long time during a busy dinner, the manager was all over us and made what could have been an unpleasant experience into a great one. I'm glad its in the neighborhood.;Silver Spring, MD;0;5;810;154;1;0

I came in for a beer and less than maybe 30 minutes after I sat down the bartender tried starting a fight with the customer sitting next to me who seemed to be minding his own business. The guest didn't even really react beyond wondering why a random employee would want to fight him. I believe the bartenders name was Nelson. He had to be pulled away and spoken to by I'm assuming a manager and the guy next to me said he was uncomfortable so he didn't finish his drink and left. I can't imagine how it would be when it's busy because there was barely anyone there and yet so much tension behind the bar.;Dale City, VA;0;2;650;126;1;0

I can could give a Zero I would it was the pathetic.Last the service at both the bar and table where hands down probable the worst I have ever had.

I was nicely surprised by their menu though, I didn't expect so much variety for an English Pub and especially for a non-meater like me, but they have a lot more than Fish and Chips and the couple of items I sampled were pretty good, especially the nut pie that my friend had (I had the Seabass, and another friend had the wild boar burger, which he really enjoyed).;Washington, DC;0;7;619;117;0;0

City Tap House Penn Quarter;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/city-tap-house-penn-quarter-washington?not_recommended_start=20;Virginia L.;4;12/21/2017;When i first saw this place on Yelp I was looking forward to taking my friends here for a night out. I haven't been for a bar in ages and I really love the idea of just drinking the night away with some good friends on a nice cozy seat. This spot has become my go to over the years, I love it but it's not perfect for a few minor reasons. One, the parking situation here is blind luck, but varies from peacefully finding a spot in five minutes to raging over not finding one in over 20. Two, the service can be so lazy sometimes, especially if it's someone new. Usually the waiters here know what they're doing, but you have those days when they forget or mix up your order, or are just absent for way too long. Three, they increased the prices of some things, including the spice wings which for me are this place's bread and butter. They're so good, not overly spicy with a truckload of flavor, but they made them a little more expensive and that honestly sucks. But still, this is an excellent bar that's sure to meet all your needs if you ever decide to check it out.;Washington, DC;0;1;1071;207;0;0

City Tap House Penn Quarter;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/city-tap-house-penn-quarter-washington?not_recommended_start=50;Simon B.;4;3/26/2014;"Very nice addition to the neighborhood. A few observations:1. The tap list is large, with the usual suspect in a gastropub: Ommegang, Allagash, Bell's, Victory, Sly Fox, Dogfish. Nothing too out there, yet good variety. Only recommendation: I'd love to see a kolsh (Mad Fox's?) on the beer list.2. They have cask and nitro. Nitro, if you've never tried, doesn't mean that Paul Walker will deliver your beer in a Mitsubishi Lancer (learn about it here fifthseasongardening.com¡­). For a stout or dark pours (try Guinness), it's incredibly enjoyable. 3. Wings: Delicious, and with the crudites served with a house vinaigrette, loved it. Don't misread ""spice wings"" for spicy, it's more like an ""all spice"" flavor. Good meaty wings, though a bit fatty.4. Samplers: $15 for 4 4oz pours. Good deal? It depends on what you want to order. The 4oz pours go from $3 to $5 or so. Unless you're going to be sampling 4 x expensive ones (most are between 3-4), it makes no sense to get the sampler. At most, you can a $2-3 discount, at worse, you order extra 4oz you wouldn't want to drink because you've had enough or you get 4 x 3$ pours?All in all though, a very nice addition to the area. I'll definitely be back.Tip: the back part of the bar area has tables, and it's first come first serve.";Washington, DC;121;521;1282;228;1;329

Great beer options and the food is really good. Blue crab mac n' cheese was good, but could've used bigger chunks crab. The Duroc Pork Collar was incredible....and I know, because my fianc¨¦ ordered it and I had the pleasure of finishing it off. The seared tuna salad was very nicely crafted and you should check out the mussels menu, as well! Buddy had the tap burger and it looked really good, if not a little over cooked from what he ordered (medium rare). Portions are generous, service is attentive and thoughtful. Huge tap;;;;;;;

She was really attuned to our table's continuous, new arrivals--always there to welcome the next person and get drink orders, refills, food, chairs, whatever we needed. Also the meat was so juicy and the BBQ was a little sweet which balanced out the spice from the peppers. I loved them. Our waiter seemed to cater to the larger crowds, than he did my two friends and I. We had to ask other waitstaff for little things like lemons, straws, and salt/pepper.  All of that being said, the restaurant certainly met our needs for the evening and we all left satisfied...!!!;Seattle, WA;3;4;688;122;1;1

Service was fine, attentive without constantly checking. Menu wasn't extensive but just enough variety to keep it interesting.

We shared desserts and appetizers, the tacos (which were outstanding) as well as the berry cobbler, also quite great. I had the steak frites, which was tasty, others at the table had mussels and scallops and were pleased. It wasn't overpriced, and there's an impressive collection. I am not a drinker, but the beer selection is seemingly extremely remarkable. Our waiter, Leigh, I believe her name is, was extremely friendly, helpful, and careful.

The beer menu is very comprehensive including various craft beers on tap. Our server, Misty the bartender, was very knowledgeable about the beer menu as well as the food menu. My guest and I each had a few craft beers based upon Misty's recommendations. Misty was able to explain each beer's attributes and what regions they were from. Her recommendations were excellent as we both enjoyed our beers thoroughly.We ordered the wings and pizza again based upon Misty's recommendation. Both were excellent in taste and size. The pizza was a thin crust homemade pizza which was excellent. The wings were also excellent and very meaty. Overall, our experience at City Tap House was excellent with outstanding beer and service.

City Tap House Penn Quarter;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/city-tap-house-penn-quarter-washington?not_recommended_start=70;James A.;5;4/24/2015;I have been coming to City Tap House for a while, drinks after work, dinner with friends, it quickly won me over. It has a certain rustic charm blended with a modern simplicity to it. And then there is the beer menu. They have 42 beers to choose from and every single one on any given week/day is a hand crafted brew from mostly small breweries around the country and a couple just plain outstanding beers from around the world that they keep on tap. A buddy of mine once asked for Bud light with that exceptional beer menu in his hands, i wanted to knock him out. Of the countless times Ive been here, Ive been served by some really exceptional staff. I have had exceptional service from Lenny, Samantha, Warren and Connor. The bar does tend to get busy, so if they can't get you the drink or eight drinks you ordered within 60 seconds, you just need to understand that you and the crowd of other people clamoring to drink from the many amazing taps need to be patient. But hey, if the locals go there regularly then it is the place you want to be, so be patient.The patio just opened for summer time but the weather has not been cooperating, however when it gets warmer I will be bringing my Rugby team for bottomless Bloody Mary's after practice on the weekends.So for food, the appetizers are all truly exceptional, any two or three can be made into a handsome meal. Hands down best entree is the Pork Collar, cheddar grits, enough said. Filet's and Ribeye's are also outstanding. I did get a pretty fatty ribeye once and quietly said something to Ryan, one of the managers, he took care of it right away, plopped a brand mew steak in front of me very quickly. The GM Pearson then came by and recognized me from many previous visits, he took good care of us. I believe the Wednesday special is the Shepard's Pie, that is truly exceptional. I see a lot of griping on yelp about prices. It is DC get over yourselves. The food here is very high quality and has a ton of flavor. The menu does seem to change regularly and it keeps getting better. Although they took a pork shank off several months ago that had the most amazing creamed spinach with it, that was a mistake. I tell you from extensive personal experience that this is the place you want to go in downtown DC.;Oakton, VA;0;1;2272;424;1;0

We push hospitality a great deal in my line of work...so when I feel a place is amazing I want to make sure others know too! We had a large group go to Tap House last week for dinner - they were so busy I feared they'd never have room for us. The staff must be accustomed to managing their inventory well, as there was a larger table in the back that worked pefectly. Right after we were seated the Manager, Pearson Keyes came by to ask us how we heard of the place and chat about why we were in town. He was warm, friendly and went over some menu items we may like to try. Over and beyond his call of duty. Then our server Kailey arrived - she was pleasant and patient, even with an exteremly full section and all 10+ of us too! She kindly separated the check as we requested and made our experience that much more pleasant. I highly recommend the place for the atmosphere, their staff and also their food!

City Tap House Penn Quarter;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/city-tap-house-penn-quarter-washington?not_recommended_start=90;Alexandra N.;5;4/15/2014;I have never had an experience like I had at City Tap House.  The first time I visited was for a corporate after party and the food, drinks and service were all great, hence why I came back a second time. The second time I came back with a party of three for dinner. At first, the host told us he would get us seated in a minute. When five minutes passed, we took a seat at the bar to order drinks while we waited. Just as we ordered our drinks, the host immediately came up to us to apologize, bought our first round of drinks, and got us seated.After being seated, our waiter apologized again for the wait (it was only 5 minutes MAX) and offered an appetizer on the house. We ended up ordering several appetizers to share and let me tell you -- absolutely EVERYTHING was incredible! All of the food is basically a really cool twist on bar food (think popcorn with bacon and candied peanuts...YUM). While we were eating, the general manager came over to talk to us. After saying that I had been there before and that I had brought new people in, he asked what I was drinking and brought back yet another complimentary drink to thank me.Don't even get me started on the desserts. The avocado honey gelato is TO DIE FOR. I honestly think this may be my new favorite spot in DC. The staff was beyond incredible, the atmosphere is fun, the beer list is overwhelming in the best way possible and the food is just unbelievable. Don't be surprised if you see me here once or twice a week now.;Washington, DC;0;9;1499;281;1;2

From the moment I entered, it felt like I had walked into a scene from Lord of the Flies. Trying to place my order was a nightmare, as I had to shout my order to a busy bartender who seemed more preoccupied with other matters.The chaos continued when my order arrived incorrectly, likely due to the blaring music that made it impossible to communicate properly. The food itself was passable at best, but the overall atmosphere left me feeling uncomfortable.To make matters worse, there was no follow-up to check if everything was alright after I received my food, despite the restaurant not being busy. The same bartender, who had been on the phone via Bluetooth, offered a puzzling excuse: ""Sorry I haven't been paying attention to you, our regional manager is visiting."" This statement was both confusing and inexcusable, considering the importance of customer service in the restaurant industry.Needless to say, I have no intention of subjecting myself to this chaotic mess of an experience at Jinya Ramen Bar ever again.";New York, NY;6;22;1088;182;1;2

At first the service was a bit of a hiccup. When we received our waters with some requests for lemons, we only got lukewarm water with no lemons. We then asked if we could have ice and was met with some attitude.Our food finally arrived and I chose the Sukiyaki Q Ramen which was amazing! I didn't even look up to speak to anyone and just enjoyed the food. Overall, despite the small occurrence I will def visit again and try a new dish as well;West Palm Beach, FL;599;25;520;101;1;36

The layout inside is very... bar like, as the name implies, but that alone makes it so much fun to eat here. I tried the Brussels sprout tempura for the first time when I was here earlier, I've always contemplated trying it and earlier I finally decided on it. It was easily one of the most interesting flavor combinations I've come across, the way the brussel sprouts crunched around the fish was super satisfying.

JINYA Ramen Bar - Washington DC;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/jinya-ramen-bar-washington-washington?not_recommended_start=40;Kristen H.;5;10/05/2024;"Jinya Ramen Bar, located on the edge of the lively Logan Circle neighborhood, is part of a renowned Japanese ramen chain famous for its deeply flavorful broths, simmered for days to achieve that perfect richness. The restaurant's imposing ebony-black exterior and towering floor-to-ceiling windows give it a sleek, modern feel. When I visited around 6:30 pm on a Saturday, the place was bustling, and as a solo diner, I had the option to wait 15-20 minutes for a table or sit at one of their two bar areas. I opted for the upstairs bar, which felt more open and airy. If you're with a larger group, I'd highly recommend booking in advance via Yelp or Google, as it seems to be a very popular spot.The interior is dark and cozy, with amber lighting casting a warm glow across the two floors, and walls adorned with Japanese-themed art that adds a touch of authenticity. The menu is extensive, offering a wide variety of ramen options, Japanese-style rice bowls, small plates like gyoza and edamame, and even vegan-friendly dishes. Jinya's ramen bowls are also highly customizable, so you can add or remove toppings based on your preferences--but be warned, those add-ons can quickly inflate the price if you're not careful.My food arrived about 15 minutes after I ordered. I opted for the JINYA Tonkotsu Black ramen ($20.20), which is loaded with toppings: pork chashu, kikurage (a crunchy Japanese wood ear vegetable, though it's sometimes replaced with spinach), green onion, nori (dried seaweed), seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, and a spicy sauce on the side. The base is a rich pork broth, and the ramen typically comes with thin noodles, though I took the advice of a friend and upgraded to the thick noodles at no extra charge. I'm glad I did--the thick noodles soaked up the rich tonkotsu broth perfectly and had that ideal ""QQ"" springy texture, which was slightly al dente but still pliable.The pork chashu portion wasn't huge (two slices), but given how fatty and flavorful it was, any more might have been too rich. The dish featured fantastic layers of flavor and texture, with the crunch from the kikurage, garlic chips, and fried onions balancing the creamy tonkotsu broth and spicy sauce. Each bite was a delightful mix of richness and acidity. At over $20 for a single bowl of ramen, it wasn't cheap, but the quality was far superior to any chain ramen I've had before, and I left feeling comfortably full without being overstuffed.For those with bigger appetites, Jinya offers combo deals where you can add an appetizer or a smaller dish like a rice bowl for under $10, which is a good value. Plus, if you're a student or using the inKind or nosh'd app, you can get great discounts (15% cash back or a 20% student discount, respectively). I had a nosh'd promotion for $10 off a $20 purchase, and with the 20% student discount, tax, and tip, my meal came to around $13--a fantastic value for such a satisfying meal!While I didn't sample their cocktail list, it features an array of intriguing drinks - I was just fully focused on the ramen this time. All in all, Jinya Ramen Bar was a lovely experience: though it's on the pricier side, their ramen is soul-warming, the service is quick and friendly, and the ambiance is fantastic. I'll definitely be back to try some of their other ramen broths!";WA, WA;7;127;3331;576;1;370

Proper 21;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/proper-21-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Trina M.;1;10/09/2020;This was such a terrible experience! Before we went to the restaurant I went on yelp and saw it had great reviews and even during the whole pandemic it had great reviews but the food was gross . There's literally no other way to say it. First off we didn't even have a full menu online they had the full menu and they handed us the kick off menu ? When there wasn't even a game ? I ordered the buffalo chicken flatbread and it was just soaked in buffalo sauce, every single bite was just sauce no indication of there being ANY chicken . So I paid 15$ to get sauce on bread? The two barely there pieces of chicken I did see had sort of half the breading on and the other half didn't which was unappetizing. the only reason we didn't cause a scene was because our waitress was a lovely woman and it wasn't her fault. I'm just disappointed that such a highly reviewed restaurant could give up this easily on trying still.

My burger was under cooked. Also, the wait to get the food was crazy. I understand that they were busy but people were getting their food who had sat after us.

Despite the inauguration frenzy, their wonderfully attentive staff and exceptional food and drinks delivered an unforgettable experience. We visited twice: first during President Trump's victory rally and again to watch the inauguration. Both times, we were blown away.The manager, Eric, was warm, inviting, and attentive, setting the tone for exceptional service. Executive Chef Felipe went above and beyond, stepping out of the kitchen to seat guests and even serve drinks when the rest of the staff couldn't make it due to the weather. His leadership and dedication were inspiring, and the food he prepared was absolutely phenomenal.On Monday, we were fortunate to have Heidi as our server. Called in to help during an incredibly crowded day, she managed to shine under the pressure. Her professionalism and friendly demeanor made the experience seamless. The drinks she served were crafted to perfection, adding to the overall excellence of the experience.What amazed us most was how the staff remembered our names the next day--it's rare to find such personal touches in such a bustling environment. Proper 21 turned a busy, weather-challenged inauguration weekend into a warm and welcoming experience.

Proper 21;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/proper-21-washington?not_recommended_start=10;Vicent B.;5;01/10/2025;It's been one of those days--meetings, emails, endless back-and-forth. So, I decide to take a break and drop into Proper 21 for a little solo escape. The place is right in the heart of Downtown DC, and I've heard a lot about it. I need somewhere to unwind, but also somewhere that feels a little different than the usual spots.As soon as I step in, I feel the energy. The vibe is loud, but in a good way--almost like being in a club but with the comfort of a great bar. There's a mix of people all enjoying the night, laughing, chatting, and the music's just right. Not too overbearing, just enough to create that lively buzz.I make my way to the bar, and the bartender greets me right away. I'm in the mood for something easy, so I go for a cider on draft. It's crisp and refreshing--exactly what I need. While I'm sipping, the bartender recommends the smash burger. I'm not sure what's so special about it, but I figure why not go with it? I also grab some wings--buffalo and gold rush. People around here seem to love those flavors, and I'm not one to pass up on a good recommendation.The place is busy but not overwhelming. It's got this clean, sleek feel, and the TVs around the bar are showing some game. I catch a few highlights, but honestly, I'm more interested in the food. The wings come out first, and I dig in. The buffalo ones have that perfect balance of heat and tang, but the gold rush wings? They're a game changer--spicy, yes, but packed with flavor. I'm hooked.As I'm finishing the wings, I hear a conversation a few stools down. Someone's raving about the service here, specifically about a bartender named Diana. They're talking about how she turned their night around after another restaurant messed up their reservation. That sounds pretty impressive, I think. I can definitely see how someone could feel taken care of here. The staff is friendly, and everything flows smoothly.The smash burger comes next. It's juicy, flavorful, and honestly, it's one of the best burgers I've had in a while. The fries are perfectly crispy, not soggy, and seasoned just right. The whole meal comes together perfectly. I start to relax, feeling the weight of the day lift off my shoulders.But as the night goes on, I realize I'm not ready to call it a night just yet. So, I pay my tab and decide to take a little walk. I'm looking for somewhere to wind down after this great dinner, and I remember hearing about a place called PullUpDC. It's not far, so I head over.When I walk in, it's got a completely different vibe--chill, laid-back, and the perfect place to just relax. I grab a blunt, kick back, and soak in the atmosphere. It's a great way to wind down after such a fun night at Proper 21. The perfect end to a great evening out in DC.;Washington, DC;0;88;2750;501;0;0

The manager stopped by to ask me how everything was and I told him his staff was wonderful! He was super friendly. I can't wait to come back and experience this place again! - my husband is very jealous I went without him;Arlington, VA;0;25;615;116;0;7

Its basically salt with a smidge of whatever food you ordered. In my case I got their rice and their 'tiger's blood ceviche'. Literally 'drank' the ceviche as there was no actual fish, it tasted like sea water. The 'fried rice' looked like they dug the rice out of the corner of the rice pot, threw it on a plate, and seasoned it with a handful of more salt! the bartenders were nice, food disgusting.

The 'callejero' ceviche was flawless--just the right balance of spice, salt, and lime. Shout out to Andres for the recommendation.We decided on a whim to stop by on an early Thursday evening. Despite the bustling crowd, the staff, particularly Clarence, was incredibly accommodating, even without a reservation.The ambiance strikes a perfect balance between upscale and unpretentious, creating a welcoming atmosphere that embraced our casual attire.Our server, Andres, was attentive, knowledgeable, and extremely helpful throughout the meal.We sampled a variety of piscos--the traditional, passion fruit, and chicha--all delicious. While the chicha was a bit heavy on cinnamon for my taste, they graciously replaced it with another flavor upon request.In addition to the outstanding ceviche, we indulged in the volcano roll, chafa, lomo salteado, pollo salteado, and pescado macho. While the entrees were good, the ceviche undoubtedly stole the show. It's a definite must-have on any return visit.The entire wait and managerial staff remained attentive, frequently checking in, showcasing exceptional teamwork and communication.Glancing around, it was evident that this place attracts a diverse crowd--groups of young adults enjoying drinks and appetizers, older couples on romantic dates, business gatherings, and families.Their bar area also seemed to be a hit among patrons.Paid for parking in a tight garage accross the street.I will definitely be returning for more ceviche my next visit to DMV area.;Cragin, Chicago, IL;153;30;1609;239;1;3

Consequently appetizer and entrees came to the table at the same time . We had to send the entrees back to the kitchen . Right after this happen, the chef came out of the kitchen to apologize about of the misunderstanding.

From the moment we entered, the ambiance was warm and invitingThe Food: A True Feast for the SensesThe menu offers a masterful blend of traditional Peruvian dishes with modern twists, ensuring there's something for every palate. We started with the Ceviche Mixto, a stunningly fresh mix of seafood marinated in tangy lime juice, garnished with red onions, cilantro, and just the right amount of Peruvian aji for a subtle kick. The fish was incredibly fresh, practically melting in your mouth, and the citrus flavors were balanced perfectly, making every bite an explosion of freshness.For the main course, we couldn't resist the Lomo Saltado, a dish that epitomizes Peruvian fusion. The tender strips of beef, stir-fried with tomatoes, onions, and peppers, were cooked to perfection, and the accompanying crispy fries and rice provided a delightful contrast in texture. The rich flavors of the soy-based sauce added depth, and each bite felt like a perfect harmony of savory and umami notes.The Aji de Gallina was another standout, a creamy chicken stew with a hint of spice, served over potatoes and garnished with hard-boiled eggs and olives. The dish was comforting, flavorful, and rich without being overwhelming, showing the kitchen's expertise in balancing flavors.Finally, the dessert: a traditional Suspiro a la LimeÃ±a. This delightful treat of creamy dulce de leche topped with airy meringue was the perfect way to end our meal--sweet, indulgent, but not cloying.The Service: Impeccable and PersonalThe service was outstanding from start to finish. Our server was knowledgeable, attentive, and clearly passionate about the food, taking the time to explain the nuances of each dish and even offering recommendations based on our preferences. The staff was warm and friendly, making us feel like we were guests in their own home. Our water glasses were always full, and our needs were anticipated without being intrusive.The Experience: More Than Just a MealThe experience of dining here goes beyond just eating;;;;;;;

They hadn't opened yet, and we were about 5 minutes early. This gave us the chance to hear the manager talk to the staff about customer service and the menus. It was a great experience to hear that side of the business. Seemed very on point. Once we were seated and ordered, we elected to go with the prix fixe brunch menu. It was a great experience and our server was excellent at describing the menu options and talking us through the selections.Our server was Sarah, and she and the rest of the team were very attentive. We received new utensils for each course - which was a small thing, but really effective.For the appetizers - the empanadas were outstanding, as was the panko shrimp. For the main course, the chicken crepes were excellent - cheesy saucy goodness, with a bit of spice to round it out.The 3d course was the sweet menu - the blueberry waffles were SO good. They are worth a leading lady award. The mimosa / sangria option was decent. The sangria was pretty sweet, but the mimosas were really good.Overall it was a very good experience. The place filled up in no time and everyone seemed to really enjoy themselves.Highly recommend.;Austin, TX;1;149;1200;213;0;65

Every bite was bursting with flavor and I couldn't get enough.One thing to note, however, is that the salmon dish can be a bit undercooked. However, if you ask for some extra grill time, it is absolutely delicious and well worth the wait.Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great food and a fun atmosphere.

I am a Peruvian, so I recognized the food items. The food here isn't traditional Peruvian food, but definitely based off of it. We had anticuchos, causas, lomo saltado con tallarines a la huancaina, suspiro de alimena. Me and my mom ate more than the table of 5 next to us! I highly recommend the food. The service took a long time but it was definitely worth it and understandable as we ordered so many plates.

Pisco Y Nazca;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/pisco-y-nazca-washington?not_recommended_start=310;Anna S.;5;01/10/2023;I recently dined at Pisco Y Nazca and was blown away by the incredible food and service! I started off with their famous pisco sours, which were perfectly balanced and full of flavor. For appetizers, I ordered the anticuchos de corazÃ³n and ceviche, both of which were delicious. The anticuchos had a great char and the ceviche was perfectly tangy.For my entree, I ordered the causa sampler, ajÃ­ de gallina, tallarines verde, and tacu tacu with honey pork. The causa sampler was a great way to try a variety of flavors, and the ajÃ­ de gallina was one of the best I've ever had. The tallarines verde was a great vegetarian option and the tacu tacu with honey pork was hearty and delicious.The real star of the night was our server, Carlyle. He was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations. He also went above and beyond to ensure we had a great dining experience. I can't recommend this restaurant enough - the food and service were both top-notch! Five stars!;Downtown, Washington, DC;0;1;988;173;0;0
Pisco Y Nazca;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/pisco-y-nazca-washington?not_recommended_start=310;Alex S.;5;01/10/2023;I recently dined at Pisco Y Nazca and it was an unforgettable experience. From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was warm and inviting. The staff was friendly and Carlyle, my server, went above and beyond to make sure my dining experience was enjoyable. He provided excellent recommendations and made sure I was well taken care of throughout my meal.The menu was extensive and offered a wide variety of traditional Peruvian dishes. I started off with the pisco sours, which were expertly crafted and had the perfect balance of sweetness and sourness. The anticuchos de corazÃ³n, or skewered beef heart, were incredibly flavorful and tender. The ceviche was also a highlight and had a great balance of acidity and heat.Next, I tried the causa sampler which included three different variations of the traditional Peruvian dish and was a great way to try different flavors. The ajÃ­ de gallina, a creamy chicken and yellow pepper stew, was rich and comforting. The tallarines verde, a green noodle dish, was also delicious and had a great balance of flavors.The tacu tacu with honey pork was my favorite dish of the evening and I couldn't get enough of the crispy and flavorful rice and bean cakes paired with the sweetness of the pork.Overall, Pisco Y Nazca exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be back for more. The food was delicious and authentic, the service was top-notch, and Carlyle made the experience even more enjoyable. I highly recommend giving Pisco Y Nazca a try! 5 STARS!;Alexandria, VA;35;9;1497;253;1;5

I'm a mother of 3 kids,I lost my husband 2years ago. He left me and my kids with a lot of debts, student loans, medical bills, tax liens and evictions. The little business I was managing to help my family with was going down, so I called my sister who lives in North Carolina, she introduced me to this Credit Specialist. He did a wonderful job on my credit report. I was amazed when I saw how everything reflected on my profile perfectly. He wiped out the bad items off my report and also loaded my account with $18,000. I got a high score of 786 with a good credit limit. This is all I can say about him compared to other good reviews I read about him on the internet. I will also refer him to anyone out there who is in need of his services. Kindly contact him on REMOTE REPAIR at CLERK dot COM;Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada;0;26;893;172;0;0

To start we had a ceviche platter and boy did it not disappoint. Everything was so unique in its on way and had such distinctive tastes. We then got another platter of different salads - chicken, shrimp and tuna - all served on mashed sweet potatoes. This tasted amazing as well and at this point we haven't even got to the mains yet! For mains we got the Lomo Saltado and the Pescado a lo Macho. Each was cooked to perfect and the portion size was massive. I wasn't able to finish it and had to take it home. All this whole we were sipping on a Pisco Sour flight - the original, passion sour, and chica sour. They worked so well with our food and was so glad that it was part of the tasting menu! At the end, we ended with some Pionono a la Monde - rolled sponge cake, dulce de leche, Nutella and gelato.

The place is very lively on a Saturday night and I truly had an amazing time with my friends out. I got the Pinazo, Ceviche Sampler, Plancha Pulpo, and Buenazo.Pinazo: the bartender has a pretty heavy hand when it comes to cocktails, and my friends all thought that their drinks were a bit overpowered by the alcohol of their choice. I agree, but i appreciate the value. Ceviche Sampler: their ceviche is perfect - not too citrusy, not too sour. The perfect way to see what they offer! I enjoyed the middle option. Plancha Pulpo: a classic and a must have. Buenazo: amazing brownie + ice cream dessert. Overall: an amazing spot to go out with your friends or family!!;Boston, MA;23;99;733;131;1;365

There's clearly a lot of thought put not only into the food, but the service and ambiance as well. The menu was somewhat intimidating, but our server Cesar was well-read and extremely helpful. As my fiancÃ©e and I aren't big seafood people, we went with the pollo causa, carne anticucho, and carne empanada. The causa is one of the coolest things I've ever tried. It reminded me of a potato salad, but with so much more flavor. For dessert, we got the bunazo, basically a brownie with more chocolate on top and ice cream on the side. The drink menu is well thought out too, with Peruvian-inspired drinks and beer. Their happy hour also runs generously late!;Washington, DC;133;306;684;120;1;434

I go every few weeks because I love the food and service. Alex is always my waiter because of his excellent service. He is so attentive and always recommends new plates for me to try. I've tried their brunch menu, lunch, dinner, and dessert menu. They outdo themselves every single time! The callejero, ceviche sampler, and anticuchos de corazÃ³n are must try plates. Alex always pairs my food with the perfect drink whether it be a traditional pisco sour or passion pisco sour. The food and drinks are delicious here. They serve authentic Peruvian cuisine! I also appreciate the COVID precautions they are taking, and I like that they offer indoor and outdoor seating.

Upon entering, I was told by a staff member that I could sit anywhere in the lounge without ""reserved"" signs. However, every table in the lounge had reserved signs, creating confusion from the start.After finally finding a seat at the bar, the bartender, with noticeably unpleasant breath, informed me that the seat was also ""reserved."" This contradicted the earlier information I received about seating options upon entering.Despite these initial setbacks, I found two available seats at the bar for myself and my cousin. To our dismay, after being told to wait ""one"" minute to order, the bartender never took our order. Later, I observed the same bartender speaking with a manager, who then stated that one of our seats was reserved. This was the second time we were informed of reserved seating after being seated without any initial indications.Feeling unwelcome and frustrated by the inconsistency, my cousin and I decided to leave and settled at a different bar to welcome in 2024 more tastefully. Overall, the miscommunication regarding seating and the lack of service left a negative impression on what was supposed to be a celebratory evening.";Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY;0;5;1299;215;1;0

dLe?a;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/dle%C3%B1a-washington-2?not_recommended_start=0;Ernie H.;1;7/30/2023;I recently ventured into the downstairs bar of DleÃ±a, eager to enjoy some good music and unwind after a long day. However, my experience at this crowded place was far from enjoyable due to the the lack of seating. Finding a spot to even stand (forget sitting) was a challenge in itself, as the seating seemed to me as if it was reserved for more special guests. Also, the atmosphere was overshadowed by the unapproachable staff. The staff appeared uninterested in providing assistance. It felt like they were going through the motions without any genuine interest. Requests for assistance were met with cold responses, and it seemed like they were doing us a favor rather than providing a service. I assume that if you don't have one of their special lockers to store tequilla in then you are going to have to stand or leave. It was disheartening to see the staff prioritize certain customers over others, creating an unwelcoming and exclusive vibe.The lack of attentiveness from the staff made it challenging to fully enjoy the music or the company of friends. The overall atmosphere in the downstairs bar was not conducive to relaxation or enjoyment, which was a significant letdown.While the music was good and performed by a live band, it was difficult to fully appreciate it in such an unwelcoming environment. The lack of friendly interactions and the noisy ambiance significantly detracted from the overall experience.In conclusion, my experience downstairs was far from pleasant.;Washington, DC;27;64;1487;246;1;34

I wanted to share my dining experience, which was unfortunately quite disappointing. Although the menu is advertised as ""bottomless,"" I was surprised to learn that this isn't truly the case. Rather, it is a large tasting menu. We were told upon sitting that the last call would be at 2:45pm. (Given that reservations are accepted as late as 2pm, I find it unrealistic to expect customers to fully enjoy the menu within just one hour). My friends and I were not finished eating by 2:45 and when I asked if I could get a box, I was told that I could not take any leftovers due to the bottomless experience, but like I mentioned, this was not a bottomless brunch. The inability to take food home resulted in a considerable amount of food waste. Further, we did not receive all items on the brunch menu, like the Caesar salad. The worst part however was that at 2:50pm, while my friend was actively chewing food in her mouth, the waiter shoved the check in her face in order to get us out by 3pm to ""prep for the dinner service"". I am extremely disappointed. I worked in a restaurant for 8 years and I never would have considered kicking out a customer before their meal had finished. I came to DleÃ±a last year and enjoyed my experience - the food is delicious. But, unfortunately, this brunch experience is enough to not want me to dine here again.";Washington, DC;0;1;1426;260;0;0

My friend disliked his drink, and no one asked if he'd like a replacement.I ordered my steak rare, but it came out well done. When I sent it back, the staff was obstinate and returned a steak that was too rare. No manager visited our table, and no compensation was offered for the mistake.

Starting with the Maryland crab guacamole, this dish was a revelation--bold yet elegant flavors that danced on our taste buds. It's a must-order! The salmon entrÃ©e was another triumph (as pictured). Perfectly seared and layered with vibrant textures and flavors, it showcased the chef's finesse and creativity.Then came dessert, and what a grand finale it was! The seasonal fruit cocktail was pure artistry. A medley of berries bathed in a light, citrusy orange juice (or perhaps a subtle hint of another infusion?), sweetened with just the right touch of agave honey. The true star, however, was the fruit espuma--an ethereal, velvety foam that was a revelation in texture. Its perfectly balanced acidity and gentle sweetness made every spoonful a delight without overwhelming the palate. Dessert alone was enough to make us linger a little longer at the table.The service was impeccable--attentive without being overbearing and prompt enough to ensure our glasses of mimosa never ran dry. Speaking of which, the mimosa selection kept our spirits high (and bubbly) throughout the meal. It's the perfect way to make a weekend feel special.Despite being nearly at full capacity, the ambiance was warm and inviting. Plenty of seating, thoughtfully arranged to maintain both comfort and intimacy. It's a great spot for both casual catch-ups and special celebrations.

However, last night we came for the exclusive 8 course chef's table menu and I was absolutely blown away. Not only were we greeted by the General Manger upon entering, he actually escorted us to our table himself and gave a small presentation before we started our journey. The Executive Chef presented all 8 courses to us himself. Even on a busy night his focus was completely on us. The food is as gorgeous as it is delicious, each course was more unique and elevated than the last. It was a beautiful evening with some truly spectacular food.

The burrata salad featured refreshing grilled watermelon, creamy burrata, and flavorful heirloom tomatoes. As a delightful conclusion, the rich cheesecake paired wonderfully with a scoop of ice cream on top. The presentations were visually stunning, and we enjoyed it all from their sunny, covered patio.

At night, it's really dark inside though and the candles don't provide much light. We came to celebrate our anniversary.Our server was so nice and funny. He was really helpful in telling us which dishes were good and which weren't. He definitely made us have an enjoyable time.Their initial ""shot"" of non-alcoholic mezcal was delicious. Their lemonade is also really good. We tried the guacamole (delicious), wagyu fajita (cooked perfectly and absolutely melt in the mouth--they forgot to bring us our tortillas and we didn't realize this until we saw it on the menu during dessert), short rib tacos (meh, the short rib was really dry), and the broccolini (a bit over charred and too oily).For dessert, we initially tried the chocolate fondant but it was not good at all. It should be liquid in the center but it was like a cooked sponge-y bread with not much sweetness. Our server comped us a new dessert--the crepe cake. This one was slightly better but overall just average. Their desserts are not worth it, in my opinion.";Los Angeles, CA;0;40;1105;186;1;72

The culinary experience at this restaurant is unparalleled--truly some of the best food I've ever tasted! Our server, Cathy, was exceptionally friendly and provided excellent recommendations. The restaurant's decor and ambient lighting created the perfect atmosphere for our date night. We kicked off our dining experience with the wagyu empanadas and hamachi mango ceviche. Simply put, wow! Those were the best empanadas I've ever savored. For our main courses, we indulged in the chicken and shrimp/crab enchiladas. Each bite was a symphony of flavors, showcasing meticulous plate composition and a harmonious balance of tastes. Every dish was delectable, and we're already looking forward to our next visit! We've even secured a brunch reservation for September.;Washington, DC;20;22;836;127;1;1

It set the perfect tone for what would turn out to be an exceptional evening. The staff was not only friendly but also incredibly attentive, making me feel truly valued throughout my visit.For my meal, I decided to go all-in and ordered the tomahawk steak with chimichurri sauce, along with a side of empanadas. The steak was an absolute delight - tender, cooked to perfection, and seasoned just right. However, the chimichurri sauce stole the show, adding a burst of flavor that was like the star on top of a Christmas tree.To complement my meal, I ordered a smoked old fashioned, which had a delightful smoky taste that paired wonderfully with my food.The empanadas were a work of art, beautifully made and packed with flavor. Each bite was a delight, and it was clear that attention to detail was a priority in the kitchen.Our server was not only efficient but also personable, engaging us in friendly banter and making us feel like more than just customers. The manager also took the time to come over and chat with us, which added a personal touch to the dining experience that I truly appreciated.In summary, Delena Restaurant exceeded my expectations in every way. The combination of outstanding food, inviting atmosphere, and genuinely friendly staff made for an unforgettable evening.

Great ambience, dimmed lights, comfortable and cozy place. The flavors and quality of the food were exceptional, and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.The short rib tacos were a highlight, cooked perfectly. The Guacamole was fresh and flavorful, adding a delightful touch to our dining experience.Only downside was the long waiting time. It was a bit frustrating to wait for our food, especially since we were quite hungry. However, once food arrived it was definitely worth the wait.The staff appeared a bit distracted during our visit, but they were friendly and accommodating nonetheless. It would have been even better if they were a a little more attentive to the customers needs.While the taste and quality of the dishes were excellent, portion sizes left a bit to be desired, especially considering the price. Although food was delicious, a slightly larger portion would have made the experience even more satisfying.Despite these minor issues, I highly recommend this restaurant for it's mouthwatering Mexican cuisine.;Downtown, Washington, DC;16;22;1105;173;1;0

Their bottomless brunch is so good! There beef tacos, street corn and churros are what I end up ordering again and again although other options are good too. I've had the pork shank for dinner a couple times which is super tender and flavorful. The only thing I don't like is that the churros are not a regular menu staple. They give them to you on special occasions with the caramel sauce which is divine! They're made fresh, served warm and yummy. You can get unlimited churros during brunch but you can tell they're not made to order and they come drizzled with chocolate and caramel. I ask for no chocolate at least which they do accommodate. The drinks are also top notch.;Bronx, Bronx, NY;0;20;733;133;1;4

Photos don't do justice as this place is so beautiful! The ambiance is elegant, classy, and warm. The seating at the bar is very comfortable. Excellent service by bartenders who are polite, efficient, and professional. Of course, the food here is phenomenal! My favorites from today were Wagyu Beef Tiradito, Pork Belly, and Ceviche Amarillo. I'm not a fan of steak in general, but their 30 Day Dry Aged Boneless Ribeye puts top-tier steakhouses in the DMV area to shame. Their tacos (Short Rib, AtÃºn, and CamarÃ³ne) are perfection. Overall, there is no restaurant that can compete with dLeÃ±a currently in DC - a class act all around. If you are looking for a romantic date spot, bring your beau here!

My wife and I ate at DleÃ±a and had a wonderful experience. It was our anniversary and we wanted to make a night of it so we went downstairs to the speakeasy bar for a night cap. They had live music which was great and had a really cool atmosphere. But it wasn't the food or drinks (which were great) that made me write this, but the service. I have lived in DC for many years but last night was the best service We have experienced since coming to this city. Our server Nancy was incredible and had such knowledge. We first were standing because it was first come first serve and when we told her we were celebrating our anniversary she immediately found us a table . When we asked her what she liked on the menu she said it didn't matter because it wasn't about her, it was about what we like and what kind of experience we wanted to have. She had us trying mezcal (which neither my wife nor I had ever had) and then gave us old fashions with tequila and mezcal! If that wasn't enough, she even brought us a dessert that had ""Happy Anniversary"" written on it. We both were confused because we didn't request it but she said she had remembered and wanted to help us celebrate.

I'm writing this review as I slurp on some leftovers and oh man, it makes me want to go back already.We came with a reservation and the seating process was quick and easy. We ordered chicken sate as an appetizer. It comes with a peanut sauce that is crunchy and flavorful and better than any that I have had before. We decided to share three dishes between us to get a little sampling of everything: curry noodle soup, pineapple curry, and fried chicken. Of the three, the fried chicken and pineapple curry were stand outs. The pineapple curry was a suggestion from a friend and I was skeptical, but DANG, it is phenomenal. Can't wait to come back and try some of the other dishes!;Washington, DC;345;113;720;130;1;12
Makan;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/makan-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Paul W.;5;11/13/2020;Decided spontaneously to come here for dinner and left with the place being one of my favorite restaurants. Tonight's dining experience was immaculate. The first thing you'll notice when you walk up are the number of available outdoor, covered seating options. Inside is a modern, but super comfortable and open dining space. The interior of this place is beautiful. I think the high ceilings, wood accents, color tones, and overall decor make this one of the nicest dining spaces in DC. The authenticity and quality of their dishes perfectly contribute to their overall vibe. Seated near the open kitchen, we could clearly see the chefs prep and hustle putting out food. The menu is unique with dishes I'm sure you can't find in the entire DMV. The servers are also the nicest and quite knowledgeable, so we deferred to our eager server who recommended a number of small dishes and entrees. We started with the chicken satay skewers, which were simple, but excellent. You can tell there was love put into that peanut sauce, which was the best I've had and a great start to the meal. The char kway teow, a flat noodle dish with shrimp and Chinese sausage is pure umami and will blow your mind. The Ayam goreng or fried chicken is confit and cooked perfectly. The salted duck yolk is a little grainy in texture, but also pure umami. My favorite dish had to be the mushroom rendang, which is not a huge portion, but unbelievably deep and layered in rich flavor. I could've eaten the mushrooms alone on white rice and been fine! Definitely get the small additions like the sambal sauce and various acars, which perfectly complement each dish and the overall dining experience. What I noticed most about this place is the complex depth and layers of the flavors. The overall dining experience blew my mind. This chef knows what he's doing and according to my Malaysian friends, the food is super authentic. They're super good with COVID precautions, so check them out.

Makan;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/makan-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Rad N.;5;3/14/2020;Was curious what restaurant would finally occupy the giant space left by Meridian Pint. Makan has filled this restaurant with fantastic food, drinks and energy! Our meal was fantastic. I was exposed to so many flavors. Excellent cocktail program and extensive beer and wine list. They kept all the draft lines. Some highlights from our meal were the Roti Jala with curry, chinese lettuce in a yummy stock, all the pickles and sambals, rendang curry, and fried chicken with salted duck yolk. There weren't any dishes we ordered we disliked. Favorite cocktail was Otaks Botak, refreshing and tropical. Will be back to try the rest of the menu.;Chicago, IL;26;15;641;108;1;86
Albi;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/albi-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Stephanie B.;2;10/20/2024;I recently dined at Albi, a Michelin-starred restaurant with good food but disappointing service. Before we were seated, I requested a simple glass of water and was refused by the host. While the dishes were tasty, the overall pace and service was terrible. I'm unsure how this restaurant can continue to maintain a star, they must take their guests for granted.

Albi;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/albi-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Prag B.;3;07/04/2021;Amazing food but server was rude. Made it awkward about a water bottle one of us had brought and strongly pushed us to get a whole chicken even though we were ordering half a chicken because we like to order and try a bunch of appetizers and usually enjoy those more than the entree. Then came to our table when we were eating the chicken and pointed out how the half that was left was what we would have gotten if we had ordered half and that it would not have been enough for us. Except we didn't eat any more of the chicken so we ended up having to box up that half chicken and take it to go anyway. The chicken was also the least impressive of their menu items so if anything we could have skipped it entirely instead of getting twice as much of it.That being said, the appetizers were some of the best Mediterranean food I have had, quite comparable to Dubai. The hummus and baba ganoush were amazing and the pairings were thoughtful and a modern take on Lebanese cuisine. The heirloom tomatoes + sauce were amazing too. I couldn't taste the labneh in the peach labneh soft serve dessert though;;;;;;;

Albi;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/albi-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Araceli K.;5;11/15/2024;Albi is a culinary journey through the heart of Lebanon and the Middle East. The menu is a celebration of fire, with dishes cooked over a wood-fired hearth that infuse each bite with smoky, charred perfection.The lamb BBQ kebab and mushroom hummus are must-tries, a harmonious blend of flavors and textures. The baba ghanoush and kefta are executed with precision, showcasing the chef's skill. However, it's the dishes cooked over the wood-fired hearth that truly shine.To fully experience the diverse range of flavors, I highly recommend the hyper-seasonal prix-fixe menu. Each course is a delightful surprise, showcasing the best of Lebanese and Middle Eastern cuisine.;Washington, DC;4;124;671;105;1;39
Albi;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/albi-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Chak C.;5;11/15/2024;My wife and I visited Albi for the first time in DC, a Mediterranean and Middle Eastern-inspired restaurant that earned its first Michelin star in 2022. Located in the Navy Yard area, the restaurant has modern dÃ©cor, an open kitchen, and a vibrant bar scene. Street parking is relatively easy to find, and reservations are a must due to its popularity.For appetizers, we started with the Sfeeha, Middle Eastern meat pies served with toum and lemon. The flatbread, freshly baked in a woodfire pita oven, was delicious, and the meat topping paired beautifully with the toum sauce.Next, we tried the Coal-Fired Mushroom Hummus with freshly baked pita. This was my favorite dish of the night! The addition of black garlic and egg yolk elevated the hummus to a new level--smooth, creamy, and irresistible when paired with the warm pita.We also ordered the Kibbeh Naya with Yellowfin Tuna, a ground raw fish dish served with puffed bulgur, lettuce, toum, and mint. While my wife enjoyed it, it wasn't a standout for me, though the tuna was well-seasoned.For the main course, we shared the BBQ'd Lamb Kebab, and it was spectacular. The lamb was incredibly soft, tender, and full of flavor, practically melting in your mouth. Accompanied by cinnamon kefta, charred delicata, and yam tahini, this dish was a highlight of the evening.To finish, we ordered Batata Harra, crispy fried potatoes tossed in shawarma spices and toum. While tasty, I was too full by then to fully enjoy it.Overall, Albi delivered an incredible dining experience with bold flavors and expertly prepared dishes. The only note is that some dishes shared similar seasoning profiles, and the generous use of toum sauce, but everything tasted fantastic. I'll definitely return to try their desserts next time!;Washington, DC;0;18;1769;291;1;54

After we complained to the manager, we were seated after another 10 minute wait. The waitress who took our order got everyone's meal wrong. I didn't get my soup, my friend didn't get his bacon, another friend didn't get cheese with her eggs. One persons order too extra long to come out after everyone else received their food.

However, as the crowd swelled and the minutes ticked by, I found myself questioning whether the experience would live up to the hype. We had a reservation and in all fairness, we arrived earlier than expected, but you wonder if the ""wait"" isn't a gimmick to drum up business for the cafe in the lobby area and the bar. I definitely almost ate BEFORE I ate...the homemade pop tarts were calling my name. While the food certainly delivered on flavor, with dishes that satisfied the palate and left me craving more, the wait-time left much to be desired. The restaurant was packed to the gills, and although the bakery boasted a tempting array of eye-popping pastries, the service fell short of expectations.Despite the unexceptional service, the quality of the food and the delightful treats from the bakery added a silver lining to the experience. Yet, it's hard to overlook the disappointment that lingers when faced with a prolonged wait and underwhelming service.In the end, Ted Bulletin offers a mixed bag of delights and frustrations.

Just last night, I ordered blueberry cheesecake tart and I was amazed at how much filling they put into it. The service is also okay, sometimes you get a little attitude from the hostess or a certain disgruntled waiter but I can get over that, especially when I know I'll be getting great tasting food for stupendously good prices.;Washington, DC;0;1;544;98;0;0

Tons of food and reasonable prices. The highlight for us -- splitting a milkshake! But, we couldn't resist one last bite so, on our way out, we had a donut hole from the bakery in Ted's entry way. We probably should have stopped ourselves because the donut hole was a tad bit dry for our tastes. Sigh...next time we should quit while we are a ahead.

If you want to impress someone with a thoughtful food item bring them a variety box of homemade pop tarts instead of cupcakes. Brunch itself was pretty good but the breakfast sandwich was overrated. The scrambled egg portion of it was like a microwaved quiche consistency with the same flavor. Also the heavily buttered Texas toast was too much richness for me. Sausage tasted infused with syrup which was kind of gross for me. Bacon, cheese, and over easy egg was legit. Hash browns were edible. Pancakes and kids breakfast man was excellent. Great place for kids but wait can be very long so plan ahead. I will go back especially for the baked goods. Service was great once seated.;Bethesda, MD;2;12;741;130;1;0

Ted's Bulletin;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/teds-bulletin-washington-3?not_recommended_start=40;Jennifer D.;4;11/30/2013;I really like this place, but the entrees did leave us a little disappointed.Ted's is a very casual, retro sort of place that serves breakfast and desserts all day. On this particular day we wanted a hot meal, so we each had entrees -- Gumbo and Country Fried Steak.The gumbo wasn't really gumbo. It had no Cajun flavor at all. It was basically rice with a lot of shrimp, and a little bit of sausage and chicken, covered with a weird sweet BBQ sauce. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't gumbo.The country fried steak was nice and crisp, but the meat itself was really low quality and entirely too chewy. The gravy was bland. The sides were nice -- Mac n Cheese and steamed broccoli.But the stars of the meal were clearly the desserts. The Oreo milkshake was pulled straight from my dreams and the apple pop tart, while too small, was perfect. Probably the best crust I've had on a pastry since Grand Ma's peach cobbler.So next time we'll skip the entrees. The sandwiches look good, as do the breakfast dishes, so that is probably your best bet.;Washington, DC;60;80;1037;189;1;0

Ted's Bulletin;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/teds-bulletin-washington-3?not_recommended_start=40;K B.;5;11/05/2024;After a whirlwind of furniture shopping, my fianc¨¦ and I decided to treat ourselves to a late lunch at this cozy spot. We were seated across from some younger patrons, and that's when we met our fantastic waiter, Keith! But I'm jumping ahead--let's start with the food!We kicked things off with some deviled eggs, which were incredibly tasty, although missing their traditional paprika sprinkle. We didn't make a fuss because they were still delightful, but made a mental note to request paprika next time. For the main course, I opted for the harvest salad--a beautiful medley of baby kale, butternut squash, walnuts, Granny Smith apples, and more. I added chicken for extra oomph, and it was absolutely delicious! Each bite was a burst of flavor, leaving me thoroughly satisfied.My fianc¨¦ went for the Caesar salad, which he declared delicious as well. We both polished off our plates, which says a lot!Now, back to Keith- our engaging waiter who indulged us in conversation about his daughter, a tennis champ in her own right. We were so enchanted by the meal and the service that we returned two weeks later, hoping to sit in his section again. Unfortunately, Keith wasn't there that day, but we're determined to catch him next time.And as for the food on our return visit? We swapped the deviled eggs for a plain version and added some calamari--light, fluffy, and utterly delightful. This place has certainly won our hearts (and our tastebuds), and we'll be back soon!;Washington, DC;3;12;1474;249;1;1

Ted's Bulletin;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/teds-bulletin-washington-3?not_recommended_start=80;Andy K.;5;3/25/2017;First time dining here and the experience was very good. We ordered the short rib sammy and the salmon entree.The short rib sammy was legit! It was recommended by our waiter Dwon ( more about him later). I found the short rib to be just right. Not too salty, loaded with deep and savory bourbon undertones and just the right amount of fatty textures. The cheese was also on point and melted to perfection. This dish was fantastic. I substituted the fries for the tater tots again at the suggestion of Dwon, and I am happy I did. They give you about 10 and let me tell you I was considering ordering a side of those to go.My wife loved the salmon. What much is there to say about salmon. It was perfectly cooked, medium, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It was a generous portion. She also substituted her side with brussel sprouts with melted blue cheese and crispy bacon. It was a very nice compliment to the salmon.So the highlight of the trip actually revolves around the dining experience itself. As our entrees arrived, almost on que, a couple was seated next to us. Very close. The moment this young man, maybe mid 40's, sat down he sneezed. Not even a minute later he begins coughing. Thats fine I'm thinking, its warm today, allergies are affecting people but it was his lack of manners and hygiene as he never covered his mouth. Well this carried on for what felt like 5 min but in reality was about 1.5 minutes. I immediately got up and asked for the manager who was a very nice young lady named Karina. She was happy to help us. She wasted no time and sat us next to the window ( major upgrade ) and had our food brought over. Funny part is we periodically looked over at the nuisance customer and would see all sorts of really gross stuff including putting his fingers in his mouth to pick out what I could only imagine was food stuck in his teeth. A really gross guy.Then there was our waiter Dwon. This young man works hard! He has a very nice positive and upbeat attitude. We really liked him. He injected just the right amount of humor and engagement without going overboard and becoming that 3rd wheel server we all have been stuck with. Dwon balanced everything out with solid menu suggestions and we will definitely be coming back and asking for him again when we make our reservation.So yeah, if you are in town traveling as we were and your looking for a great spot with a really nice atmosphere this is a good choice.

The diner ambience is fantastic, and the black and white tvs gave off a 1950s pop store vibe. First of all, the homemade pop tarts are so worth the hype. We had the salted caramel pop tart with the Big Mark Breakfast. The sausage was some of the best we've had. The service was fantastic, and since the restaurant allowed us to call ahead we were seated in no time. Great experience, and we will definitely return.;Washington, DC;0;13;462;87;0;4

He answered all our questions very accurately. The way in which he carried himself and held eye contact with each one of us showed how confident he is in his work. Excellent job, Judah!As for the food, death by chocolate! The chocolate milkshake (non adult version) was delicious! However, I couldn't finish the little extra they give you on the side.

Perhaps it's because I've only been when it's busy but the set up and flow of the space seemed congested and flowed poorly, the drinks and food I ordered were underwhelming and their was a miscommunication that caused my items to sit for many minutes after being ready.

Their coffee is top-notch, and the breakfast biscuit, well, it's my absolute favorite!The ambiance here is a winning combination of cleanliness and hip vibes, making it an ideal setting to either catch up with friends or get some work done on your laptop. But, here's the catch - there's no WiFi available, and that's the main reason I don't visit as often as I'd like to. Usually, when I drop by, it's either a quick bite and run, or I spend a little time sipping coffee and people-watching. I've noticed others around with laptops, but I'm not sure how they're managing to get connected. Despite the connectivity hiccup, the food and coffee never disappoint.So, if you're in for a fantastic breakfast and don't mind missing the WiFi, this place is perfect for you.

It's like having a delicious siren song calling my name every time I walk by. The baked goods are chef's kiss. The biscuits are flaky and buttery, the croissants are perfectly golden brown, and the Sammy sandwiches are packed with flavor.But even though the food is amazing, there are a few things that keep me from giving this place a perfect five stars. The coffee is just okay, and I wasn't a fan of the chocolate croissant. (I mean, come on, chocolate croissants are supposed to be decadent, not meh.)I'm also knocking off a star for the service on the weekends. It can be so slow. I mean, I get it, the place is packed, but I'm not trying to wait 30 minutes for a biscuit.I do order online now though.Overall, A Baked Joint is a great spot for baked goods if you're nearby.

A Baked Joint;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/a-baked-joint-washington-9?not_recommended_start=40;Billy G.;4.0;12/30/2017;I agreed with my wife that this was an ideal place for brunch as soon as we found out about it right here on Yelp. It's getting decent reviews, and looked like a promising locale that could become our go to for brunch/lunch. Yesterday was me and my wife's first visit here, it seemed charming but I couldn't tell because it was so darn full inside. The biscuit Sammie was a real interesting dish which we both enjoyed, and it goes really well with tea, especially a sweeter kind. It's a little too crowded in here to be able to stay for long and keep your composure, it's just a very loud scene inside and I'm sure that if they switched their layout into a more spacious one it'd instantly feel less crowded.;Washington, DC;0;1;708;133;0;0

Whenever I'm in town, I make it a point to stop by, and there's one dish that I simply can't resist - the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e French toast. It's nothing short of amazing, a heavenly indulgence that always leaves me craving for more.During my recent visit, I decided to broaden my horizons and explore their menu further.

It really depends on when you are visiting, as workdays are more quiet and enjoyable than weekends when there is an issue finding a seat where you can enjoy your breakfast/pastry/coffee in peace.Cleanliness: Clean and neat.Price: Adequate for the ingredients, location, and demand.;Washington, DC;18;147;975;157;1;118

The little business I was managing to help my family with was going down, so I called my sister who lives in North Carolina, she introduced me to this Credit Specialist. He did a wonderful job on my credit report. I was amazed when I saw how everything reflected on my profile perfectly. He wiped out the bad items off my report and also loaded my account with $18,000. I got a high score of 786 with a good credit limit. This is all I can say about him compared to other good reviews I read about him on the internet.

It has great ambience in slightly tight quarters. I went with a group of friends, I thought the appetizer trays were fun as a novelty, but didn't think the potstickers were that good and tasted like they might be frozen and not homemade. The Dan Dan Noodles were better, they had a nice spicy kick. The highlights were the drinks, I had the Old Fashioned and Bourbon Smash, both were very good.

The restaurant specializes in Peruvian food and the ambiance is so beautiful. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were so cheerful and helped us understand the menu. They even let us sample pisco which is a special Peruvian liqueur. We happened to be sitting next to the owners who are beautiful inside and out. They were so hospitable and they showed us around the restaurant and how all their decor was from their Ecuadorian and Jordanian heritage . The owners wife even gave me one of her bracelets that is a combination of both her and husbands cultures. Everything is so local, freshly made and there is just so much culture to appreciate. The flavors of everything are so amazing and I just can't say enough good things about the place.

The mezcal last word is really tasty and overall the drinks are nice and strong. The food I thought was decent, an okay place to try some Greek food. I had the chicken kebab and I wish they had more vegetables! It was an overwhelming amount of chicken and not enough flavor for me but I did love the veggies. My friends had a rack of lamb they devoured and their burger which was just average. If the restaurant is busy it gets loud but it is conveniently close to the metro.

Despite having a prior reservation, the staff at the door insisted we couldn't be seated until our entire party arrived. Even after explaining our situation, with a couple arriving with a newborn and requesting an outside seat, our plea was disregarded, and the staff showed a lack of concern. Once everyone was present, including the newborn, the insistence on confirming our presence was accompanied by rude behavior when we explained the child couldn't enter.To add to the dismay, upon finally being seated, our table was adorned with dirty dishes, and two of our ordered plates never made it to our table. This level of service was profoundly disappointing and arguably one of the worst experiences I've encountered in years.

Then the waitress comes and we told her we still had to look over the menu, then she disappears for a while. At this point we just gave up and left and did not order anything. No way the atmosphere and the way the night went would have been pleasant for us to stay and actually have the dinner.

Service - Not great, our waiter wasn't paying much attention throughout the experience. First, he very nonchalantly dropped off our charcuterie board, left it sitting on our table for a minute or so, and before any of us could touch it, picked it back up and gave it to another table(???) He then brought the two people he gave our board a second charcuterie board, then gave us an identical board to the first a little later.

Ordered a pitcher of Traditional White Sangria, the pitcher is large and fills about 7 or 8 glasses. Pitcher arrived after about 30 minutes, they must have been making it per order (no time for the fruit to infuse the sangria). My wife drank only two glasses because she said it didn't taste very good. Since I couldn't taste any alcohol I casually finished off the pitcher. I normally can feel two glasses of wine, but after drinking 5-6 glasses of this sangria I noticed no effects. The price is great for the pitcher of Sangria, about $26, but you just get a marginally refreshing drink that in my opinion contains maybe a cup or two of weak wine at best.

The atmosphere was lively and vibrant, with a packed bar area that almost felt like a nightclub. It was so crowded in the bar area that it was hard to move around, but the energy was electric. While the packed atmosphere made it a little too noisy for a romantic date night, it would be a great spot for a night out with a big group.

Recent Saturday night 9pm reservation our party of five waited for an hour at the bar for our table. The place was packed, both the restaurant and bar. Finally made it to our table, placed our order and the drinks arrived. A minute later the manager came over and said our drinks were on the house and apologized for the long wait despite the reservation. WHAAAAT?I have never, in my many decades of going to restaurants have a manager come over and provide complimentary anything without prodding! Hats off to Barcelona and a manager who clearly wants to ensure EVERY customer is satisfied, and given the fact it has been packed every time I've been there he could have easily have not taken the time or initiative...they're not hurting for business!

Barcelona Wine Bar;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/barcelona-wine-bar-washington?not_recommended_start=30;John M.;4.0;9/30/2015;One of the best restaurants in DC, but the service is a little slow due to their large crowd. They also pack the place beyond it's capacity, so being by the bar is the equivalent of being packed like a sardine. I recently went with a group of 6 for dinner, split a few bottles of wine and charcuteries (the server did a great job of recommending which wines paired best with certain foods). All in all, it's a landmark restaurant on 14th St, I just think they need to consider hiring more food runners and servers, and be a little more cognizant of how small the bar space is for the crowd they try to accommodate.;Washington, DC;4;9;616;117;1;1

Barcelona Wine Bar;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/barcelona-wine-bar-washington?not_recommended_start=40;Simon B.;4.0;8/26/2014;On a Friday evening, this place had more beautiful women than a yoga retreat offering free Lululemon gear. That's a plus, of course, unless you have short attention span in which case you'll leave with a stiff neck. Fair warning.Food-wise, it was mostly very good. The patatas were excellent, as commented by the many reviewers here. We were not impressed by both the calamari and the hanger steak (poorly cut, little flavor), but the figs absolutely saved the day. Just order them.The service was pretty good too, though it was thoroughly embarrassing to see these new waiters just thrown in and have no clue about any of their dishes or drinks. That said, we got the most attentive service one can imagine. I'd say it's a great place to go munch on a few tapas with friends, grab a few early drinks, and then go off to a real dinner.;Washington, DC;121;521;835;150;1;329
Barcelona Wine Bar;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/barcelona-wine-bar-washington?not_recommended_start=40;Lisa D.;4.0;7/23/2014;Barcelona! I soooo enjoy the two times I've come to visit , each time as a walk-in, and the place is amazingly vibrant and a magnificent scene. I've enjoyed the marvelous Spanish-style tapas: bravas, empanadas, spinach/chickpea casserole, hanger steak...all those and more! I have been supremely impressed by the venue, the music, the food, the staff...in not necessarily in that order. Which makes it really difficult to write what I'm about to write now.I was in last night for dinner with the visiting family of a dear friend here in Washington, DC. They are European and get t\o our city maybe once a year. They are very well-traveled (like most Germans!) and love it when we find new and exciting restaurants to take them to. Barcelona was a natural for this dinner.There were four of us and we were seated in the area located in the rear of the restaurant closest to the restrooms. Or server was Christina working with fellow servers Mark and Chris. It was a very busy night even for a Tuesday, and the room was packed. We were being taken care of quite well. Christina was delightfully attentive, without being intrusive, Mark was all over the place it seems filling water glasses and clearing plates with great skill. Chris was focused on a line of tables and was slightly bumbling. He never had a need to approach our table, however.Here's the crux of my review.Mark went to the bar to apparently retrieve drinks. He had explained to us very casually that he was a back waiter supporting the two front waiters Christina and Chris. I thought this a great concept and it seemed to be working very well as Christina and Chris were preoccupied with getting tables jump-started with Mark providing superlative support to them both;;;;;;;

The little business I was managing to help my family with was going down, so I called my sister who lives in North Carolina, she introduced me to this Credit Specialist. He did a wonderful job on my credit report. I was amazed when I saw how everything reflected on my profile perfectly. He wiped out the bad items off my report and also loaded my account with $18,000.

Having lived in Spain, we can honestly say this is the closest you'll get to authentic Spanish food in the US - and some things were even better (including the croquettes, tortilla, and flan)!

Massimo, our bartender who was very delightful. He had a smile and positive attitude that even me and my husband wish we could have. We were very much bothered by an obnoxious group of people near us. They were very rude and condescending to the bartenders by constantly interrupting us when we trying to order and ask questions about the food items.

It felt like I was at (my former) home! After living in Spain for six years, anyone would fall in love. From the lighting to the menu, open windows, friendly and helpful staff, I was impressed....Barcelona is the best replication of cuisine and charm offered, without the pricey airline ticket to Europe! Since I dined alone, I sat at the bar. Once I decided which tapas to order, the bartender (Lacey) made amazing wine/cocktail suggestions based off my order, to cleanse my pallate.

Gerrard Street Kitchen;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/gerrard-street-kitchen-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Milana H.;3.0;04/04/2023;The ambiance is definitely classy and upscale so I expect so much more from this restaurant. Customer service was a bit lacking. The waiter seems like he was new and was forgetting to ask basic things like asking how I wanted my steak cooked before walking off. It was a very weird vibe that I couldn't put my finger on. The food was mediocre. The Petite filet was dry, over cooked and under seasoned. The cognac sauce and potatoes it came with were a delicious though. The Risotto faired a bit better and was actually very tasty with the scallops and shrimp. The NY strip was seasoned well and had the best potatoes of all 3 steak dishes. The shrimp cocktail was good as well and the cocktail sauce seemed freshly made. The salmon roll had no structural integrity. It presented well but basically crumbled as soon as it was picked up. It also sat for a bit and had gotten warm. But now to the wonderfully presented Heaven's Sakura, a $17 drink. The drink's presentation is gorgeous and you just know it's gonna be amazing...yea no. This drink either needs to be taken back to the drawing board or removed from the menu forever. This drink was DISGUSTING and was only finished because it was $17. It tasted like a drink you would mix as a kid on a dare. The crunch bar was the only thing on the menu I truly enjoyed it was delicious! I don't think I will be coming back since first impressions are everything and Gerrard's didn't pass the vibe check.;San Diego, CA;88;37;1450;267;1;32

RumiÂ’s Kitchen;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rumi-s-kitchen-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Farouk A.;1.0;12/13/2024;Today, I visited Rumi's Kitchen in Washington DC, where I am a regular customer. Upon arriving, there was no one at the door to greet us, and we waited for about 4-6 minutes before being seated. When I asked to sit at my usual table, which I visit at least twice a week, they accommodated me. However, after being seated, we waited for 9 minutes without being greeted or offered water.I decided to speak to the manager and expressed my concerns about the service, as it was unusually poor compared to my previous experiences. The manager acknowledged the feedback, and we proceeded with our meal. Unfortunately, the issues didn't end there. The server, who also doubled as the bartender, brought us boxes for our leftovers but refused to wrap our food, which is usually done by the staff. After requesting assistance again, the second manager was dismissive, and we felt increasingly unwelcome.We paid our bill of $180 and even tipped the bartender $50, but as we were leaving, the manager told us we needed to leave immediately, which only added to the unpleasant experience. Overall, this visit left much to be desired, especially for a loyal customer.;Washington, DC;0;3;1154;197;1;2
RumiÂ’s Kitchen;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rumi-s-kitchen-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Afi A.;1.0;10/06/2024;I normally don't have the habit of writing a review, but my recent experience was so awful that I decided to do it. I recently dined at (Rumi's kitchen, in DC), and I must say, I was incredibly disappointed with the experience. The service and the food were not bad, but when they brought the bill, they overcharged us. Why? Because we were 15 people and they said if it's more than 10 people, they charge each person $100. Why? I don't know. Nobody knows. They didn't care that each of us ate much much less than $100 . And we had 4 kids under the age of ten, how much can they eat?! I've never heard such a thing. It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. They absolutely positively didn't do anything special in order to charge us double. And the person in charge was no where to be found. She was off and wouldn't take our calls. And there was no manager there who could help us resolve this issue, or so we were told. Overall, ( Rumi's Kitchen, in DC) failed to meet even the most basic expectations of a pleasant dining experience.

Apps come with a bread basket - warm bread and delicious. Very cool that they have huge slabs of bread hanging from the ceiling that you can see in the kitchen while you're dining :)As for food, I split the rack of lamb and the shrimp with my partner. The rack of lamb was cooked perfectly - great flavors. The shrimp were massive! Meaty grilled shrimp that were super delicious. Both dishes came with rice (with raisins and dried fruits, so yum) and a grilled tomato. By the end of dinner we were STUFFED. I wish we had saved space for dessert!Our water was AWESOME.

Han Palace;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/han-palace-washington-2?not_recommended_start=0;Kristen H.;3.0;6/29/2024;"Han Palace in Woodley Park, with additional locations in Georgetown and McLean, has become a go-to dim sum spot for many, thanks to its alluring happy hour and bottomless drink deals. Despite the unassuming exterior--nestled quietly among other ""ethnic-adjacent"" spots like Nando's and Indian restaurants--the interior is beautifully decorated. Hanging plants, warm ambient lighting, and Chinese-style calligraphic art adorn the walls. The fun tiled bar showcases a plethora of alcoholic beverages and features large flat-screen TVs broadcasting sports and news. While they don't take reservations, you can call ahead to inquire about wait times.On a Saturday night at 6pm, our party of six only waited about five minutes for a table. Our server was brusque, asking for our orders within two minutes of seating us (we needed more time). The dim sum menu, though not as extensive or authentic as other places and a bit pricier, features a mix of Americanized entrees, vegetarian-friendly fare, and traditional noodles, rice dishes, and vegetables. Dishes started arriving about 10 minutes after we ordered, which was fairly quick.We began with the Shrimp Dumpling ($5.50 for 3 pieces), which were small, with an oddly textured shrimp filling that lacked seasoning. However, the rice flour wrapper was well-made. The Pork Dumpling with Fresh Crab Roe ($5.50 for 3 pieces), or Siu Mai, was decent--juicy pork with a nicely formed wrapper, though the crab roe was barely noticeable. The Steamed Chicken Claws ($5.50) were a standout deal, offering a generous amount of marinated chicken feet with a good balance of skin and cartilage.The Roasted Pork Buns ($6.95 for 3 pieces) had a soft, pillowy bun, but the filling was an odd mashed texture that didn't taste much like pork. The Soup Dumplings ($11.95 for 6 pieces) were liked by some but failed to impress, especially given the high price. The Scallion Pancake ($4.95) was well-received for its crispy texture.Among the entrees, the Lo Mein dishes (starting at $14.95) provided a large amount of noodles but skimped on the meat. They were enjoyable but no better than typical Chinese takeout. The General Tso's Chicken ($18.95) was generously portioned and tasty but nothing special. The Ma Po Tofu ($15.95) was a highlight, offering a delectably spicy dish with silken tofu in a rich sauce, and my friend appreciated the leftovers.The Crispy Roasted Pork ($15.95) had a rich, fatty flavor but was disappointingly thin and small in portion. The Garlic Chinese Broccoli ($15.95) was extremely bland and swimming in oil, making it a poor value. However, the Purple Gold Yolk Bun ($6.95 for 3 pieces) was a delightful end to the meal, with its unique lilac color, soft dough, and rich custard filling.Overall, Han Palace offers a pleasant dining experience with a beautifully decorated interior and quick service. However, the food lacks authenticity, the prices are high, and the service is brusque. While it's not a bad spot for a casual meal, you might be better off seeking more authentic dim sum at places like Da Hong Pao, or venturing further out into Virginia to quell your fix.";WA, WA;7;127;3133;508;1;370

Ambar;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ambar-washington?not_recommended_start=10;Layne C.;4.0;12/21/2017;I've never been one to eat out but I came here last night when a couple of friends decided to hang out and I thought It'd be cool to eat here since I drive past this place almost every day. The food here was very intriguing, I noticed that the dishes here aren't just your typical Western European entrees, instead there was a lot of Eastern European and Balkan cuisine which I was super eager to try. The manager was Serbian and he was so warm and courteous with us, he mentioned how he always likes to chit chat with new first time visitors and ask them what they think of the dishes. I've never ever had this kind of food before I came here, so I was very much looking forward. We decided to order the Balkan Experience - $40 for an all you can eat or drink session with mimosas included. I thought it was an absolutely fair deal, but the food didn't impress me so much. It didn't really have an oriental or exotic vibe to it, more of a redo for many common US and Western European recipes. The Balkan salad was excellent and really surprised me with the paprika they used for it, I haven't had such refreshing tasting paprika before. The manager mentioned that they were Balkan paprikas when I complemented the salad, at least something did manage to surprise me after all.To finish off, I think this is a wonderful establishment that tries hard to satisfy, and there's no reason not to want to eat here.;Southwest Washington, Washington, DC;0;1;1408;263;0;0

Ambar;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ambar-washington?not_recommended_start=20;Toni J.;4.0;1/23/2013;While I've been to the Balkans and experienced their culture - this place actually hits it pretty close to genuine. I went there with few of my friends last week and we had GREAT time. The atmosphere is so welcoming and worm, staff is amazing. From hostess who was more than welcoming, through our server who was amazing. We also met general manager Urosh who gave us a great restaurant tour, introduce us with different flavors of rakija and great chooses of vino from Balkan.But let me tell you something about their great food. For an appetizer we had proja with ajvar, urnebes and kajmak. AMAZING!!!!! They got my vote after a first bite of food. It brought me back to the days when I travel through Balkan countries. I was totally in love in sarma, great presentation and even batter taste. With sopska salad you can never go wrong as well as cevap and traditional pljeskavica. No TV's, Balkan employees, Balkan food & wine, Balkan music playing in the background. Such a great night!!! Thanks Balkan people for taking care of us and bringing Balkan in DC. We were all totally in love and cannot wait to come back.Literally, If you want to experience the Balkan culture without hopping on a plane to Belgrade then I'd suggest you pop over to Ambar.;Washington, DC;32;8;1253;223;1;0

Ambar;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ambar-washington?not_recommended_start=20;Renee M.;5.0;10/15/2024;"I can not say enough about AMBAR. The food, atmosphere and friendly staff make this a no-brainer for brunch, lunch or dinner. I have had the pleasure of visiting the Capitol Hill location on three occasions. Twice for the brunch and once for dinner. I discovered this amazing place when looking for a new brunch spot that was close to my home with reasonable pricing and a interesting menu. After investigating their menu options, I made a reservation for the upcoming weekend and invited a friend. We arrived and were seated on the upper level of this small but mighty Balkan restaurant. Their tag line, ""NEXT-LEVEL BALKAN DINING WITHOUT LIMITS"" adequately describes the experience you will have. It's possible that I have tried just about every item on the menu for brunch at this point since it's unlimited and you can have it all. They also have an unlimited drinks add-on. A few of my favorite are the Beet Tzatziki spead, fried chicken, the hanger steak, Balkano and the Shrimp and bacon, oh and the BREAD. I don't like leaving out all of the other delicious items because they also deserve recognized. I have visited unlimited plate restaurants in the past that have good food, but the service is slow and that limits your ability to try whatever you'd like. This has not been the case during any of my visits to Ambar. The wait staff and servers are quick, friendly and your items are brought to you hot. They keep it coming even when the restaurant is full. I don't think you can find a better value and more tasty food anywhere else in DC specifically. If so, please let me know and I will be happy to give them a try. One last thing, Costco sells 4 $25.00 gift cards to Ambar for $79.99.";Washington, DC;4;52;1699;306;1;65

I recommend trying anything and everything that you might be even the slightest bit interested in, because it's all pretty delicious.

Ambar;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ambar-washington?not_recommended_start=80;Amal A.;5.0;7/29/2018;I stopped here with a group of friends for a birthday celebration on a Saturday. I reserved this place a month in advance as we were a large group. We had a pre set 'Balkan experience' at $39 each. This brunch is spectacular, unlimited food and drinks.Favorite items on the menu that I would recommend trying are mezze platter, roasted mushroom crepe, cinnamon sweet sourdough, poached pear waffle, steak and eggs and salmon benedict. Now, steak and eggs is probably the best I've tried, its the most popular dish and therefore, you can only place two orders at a time for a table which was a little annoying but worth the wait. Let me say that portions are small like tapas style, meant for sharing, therefore order as many dishes as you can and want to try! For a busy Saturday brunch service was excellent!! This is so far my favorite all you can eat type of brunch. I will definitely go back!;Washington, DC;32;11;896;163;1;15

Ambar;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ambar-washington?not_recommended_start=100;John R.;5.0;1/25/2013;My wife (Who is Serbian) and I went to Ambar last night. After some time to mull over our experience I have to give it a glowing review. I frequently feel like I am expected at restaurants to accept that I am in DC and will pay a premium for things you can get elsewhere more cheaply. I did not feel that was the case at Ambar (though for some, they may still see the menu as being too pricey).Service was excellent, if I had to dock a point somewhere it would be that the servers are maybe too attentive but frankly I prefer that in a restaurant with this price point. My waitress was pleasant and helpful, and quick to assist with anything I needed. The support staff also seemed very approachable which I appreciated. The general manager Uros came to speak with us and I had a great time talking about the restaurant in general.Drinks were great, though I couldn't bring myself to drink the Serbian beer at US prices considering it's about $2-$3 in Belgrade. Sorry guys! They do have some bottles priced a little steep for my taste, though Balkin drink isn't about beer! The wine and liquors were top notch, and I felt made up for the expensive beer. While I do like a New Belgium Trippel, the opportunity to have some uniquely Balkin grape wines was exciting. I also enjoyed all of the rakija I tried, though it may not be for everyone. The closest I could equate it to is brandy, but if you are in the mood for something to warm you up you can't get anything better. The bar also has several cocktails and a cool selection of spirits ranging from vodka to scotch.Food was awesome. The plates are small, slightly larger than tapas. Definitely try the white veal soup, as well as the veal stew. Bacon wrapped prunes... oh man. I would go on more here but I have a feeling you can't really go wrong with the food. It seemed that every option we had was great, and I felt like I was getting an amazing flavor with every bite.Atmosphere is excellent. A cozy modern take on a barn, with agricultural notes mixed in with inviting glass and wood.Definitely coming back. I'm interested to see what happens in the coming months.;Arlington, VA;81;8;2123;392;1;0
Ambar;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/ambar-washington?not_recommended_start=100;Jack S.;5.0;1/21/2013;My girlfriend and I went there on Saturday night. We've never been in any of Balkan countries but I after dinning in Ambar I think that out next vacation will be visiting Balkan countries, especially Belgrade. Our waiter was born and raised in Balgrade. We learned so much about their culture and he gave us great suggestions about the food. Of course that he knows what is the best. There were no mistakes. We tried sopska salad, cevapi, sarma and gibanica. OMG!!!! I was in haven. Everything was so authentic and cooked to perfection. We met great people there and we felt like part of the family. One of the managers stopped by at the table and explains the dÃ©cor of the restaurant is what AMBAR is. He also gave us a taste of Balkan with a traditional rakija. What strong liquor but you have to know how to drink it, that's what he said.I felt warm like I was in a cabin. I'm really thankful for places like Ambar because if there weren't places like this, restaurants would always be contemporary but stone cold...you know what I mean. I will see you soon my friends!!!;Washington, DC;10;5;1074;196;1;0

ChaplinÂ’s;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/chaplins-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Corinne Z.;1.0;1/27/2018;"First off, God only knows why the proprietors thought to combine Japan and Charlie Chaplin, considering Japanese untranationalists tried to assassinate the silver screen star in 1932 to incite political crisis out of revenge.I would have enjoyed the fairly decent food if I hadn't drowned in the cacophony of nonsensical music ranging from 2000s garage punk to Spanish merengue to electronic house pop. Meanwhile they project silent Chaplin films on the wall, except that people are too distracted by the waitstaff's uniforms. Waiters and waitresses rush around in a fashion catastrophe of traditional black server uniforms overlaid with suspenders that look like they came from Hot Topic. But the Hot Topic/Spencer's look is probably appropriate given the horrible decor, which looks like it was chosen by an edgy middle school scene girl who combined her fascination with ""mature"" dark colors with her manga obsession -- the only fathomable reason why Japanese influences could be imagined in this dark, claustrophobic, musically tone deaf, town house trying to pass itself off as a restaurant when it can barely put together a sensical theme. Did I mention the smell of butane hanging in the air? Beyond aesthetic concerns, our waitress was curt, vocally abrasive, and rushing us out the door. Sadly, we were still hungry when we were finally pushed out as she did not put one of our orders in. I wish we could have rectified this omission, but she checked in on us once every fortnight, too busy mixing drinks at the bar.

ChaplinÂ’s;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/chaplins-washington?not_recommended_start=20;Kimberly K.;5.0;08/11/2023;Chaplin's is one of my go to spots in Shaw! LOVE that they offer fresh noodz made in house, and their frozen cocktails are low key lifechanging. DEF recommend their seasonal cold ramen, and their mappo maze's probably one of the best noodle dishes I've had in DC. PS. their patio is dog friendly, and they have a killer happy hour DAILY so make sure you pay them a visit. PSS. they have these whiskey injected dumplings that are REALLY yum and insta-worthy, lol. They'll fill them up for you right at your table.;Hanover, MD;568;234;517;94;1;431

ChaplinÂ’s;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/chaplins-washington?not_recommended_start=20;Susan D.;5.0;7/24/2023;This place has a unique and vibrant vibe that instantly draws you in. The fusion of Japanese and American flavors creates a menu that is both intriguing and satisfying. During happy hour, the cocktails shine with their creativity and balance. The Fried Wontons are a delightful start, crispy and filled with savory goodness. Vegetarian Gyozas offer a tasty twist on the traditional dumpling. But the real stars of the show are the ramens. The Mappo Maze packs a spicy punch, not for the faint of heart but a treat for those who can handle the heat. The Chaplin ramen, on the other hand, takes you on a unique culinary journey with its complex flavors. And if you have room for dessert, the ichigo parfait is a delicious treat to share, combining the flavors of strawberry shortcake with a satisfying crunch of corn flakes. The prices are a bit on the higher side, but the happy hour specials make it a great value for a memorable dining experience.;Washington, DC;5;23;948;167;1;0

This place never fails to impress. From the moment I walked in, I received excellent assistance. The restaurant offers a variety of seating options, and my friend and I decided on the bar, which turned out to be a great choice. The Bartender on the bottom floor is a true mixologist, and watching him craft our drinks and others was a delightful treat. I ordered an espresso martini, a days pleasure, and the cure. All amazing drinks. The overall atmosphere was very relaxed and laid-back, creating a perfect setting for a great evening. Our drinks and food were served promptly, and I must say, the Chaplin Ramen with extra nori, ground pork, bok choy, and spicy sauce was simply amazing! The flavors were on point, and I loved the fact that they encourage guests to customize their ramen by adding extras for the full experience.Chaplain certainly stands out among other restaurants for its top-notch service, skilled bartenders, and delicious dishes. I highly recommend trying their ramen with all the extras for the ultimate dining experience.;MD, MD;0;17;1101;183;0;66

When we first arrived, we seated ourselves as there was no host at the door. Shortly after, an angry, short Indigenous man named Wilson approached us. In a rather confrontational manner, he demanded that we get up and go back to the door to request a seat. There was no one waiting, but it seemed like he was on a power trip, making us form an unnecessary line.Things only got worse from there. Wilson started verbally attacking my wife and me, scolding us for not waiting at the door. I explained that there were no signs posted or a host available, but he seemed intent on making a scene. This place is an absolute dump when it comes to service. To top it off, after enduring his rudeness throughout our meal, Wilson confronted me in front of the entire restaurant because I refused to pay him a 20% tip for his ""service"". It was humiliating and completely uncalled for.As for the food, it was mediocre at best. I've had much better, and this certainly isn't authentic Mexican cuisine. It's more of a watered-down Tex-Mex, akin to street food, but not in a good way. Overall, the horrendous service and subpar food make this place one to avoid. There are plenty of other restaurants that offer better food and much better service.";Brownsville, TX;0;5;1395;243;0;0

The tinga tacos were a delight, and the enchiladas with rice and beans were unbeatable. It turned out to be the best impromptu Valentine's dinner at home!;Washington, DC;10;21;912;155;1;2

The other day I resisted my usual fare and my table tried the flautas (rolled up chicken taquitos), mussels + chorizo, and the green salsa chilaquiles. Everything was delicious and of a caliber I haven't seen since I left California. Their fajitas are solid, although not very inventive as a dish (and that's generally the case everywhere).

I am in a committed relationship with this joint and have no plan on breaking up anytime soon. The restaurant is small, so the long wait is a turn off for some, but I have found that the best things come to those who wait...including this Mexican food. It's a hidden gem in the Shaw neighborhood but has seems to get busier and busier every time I go in. The menu is ginormous, which is overwhelming at first, but then you realize that this overwhelming feeling is the kind of feeling you want as there are SO many delicious options to choose from. We started with the nachos and usually when you order nachos out, the chip-to-topping ratio is weak, but fear not. El Sol has got your back in this department. A loud atmosphere, not ideal for a first date as people mainly seem to go there for the great food and not intimate conversation. These days, every restaurant deems themselves as ""authentic"" where I call bullsh*t most of the time.

The bartenders are superb, and the wines are great. But unfortunately the quality of the food has dropped since the early days. The details are off on the small plates (too much liquid on the plates, octopus salad is tough and not properly flavored, pizza crust is too wet!) And last evening I showed up without my complete party and the hostess tole me it would be 10-15 minutes for a table. 10 minutes later, when my party was complete, I was told it would be 20 minutes longer. The hostess said that this was because other, complete parties had arrived and taken the tables in the meantime. If that is the system then on what basis can the hostess give a time estimate? The communication was deliberately misleading, and this kind of treatment of regular (neighborhood) customers is the height of arrogance for a restaurant that cannot maintain its quality.

When I had to use the restroom I asked the bartender where the restroom was and I went there, when I came back from bathroom my whiskey was tossed and beer was left alone, I was thrown off as to why my whiskey was tossed and I didn't drink it yet, and none of the bartenders could answer so I asked for another one and they charged me for both whiskey which was unacceptable. Then I ordered food to go because I was uncomfortable being there and I have allergy to pork and they told me they could fry my chicken in regular oil because normally everything is fried in pork oil, nasty btw, but when I'm getting ready to leave I check bag to make sure everything was there, I had 3 small chicken sandwich. I run to bathroom again before I Leave and I then I head out with my food to go and check again and one of my sandwiches were missing.

She was mostly no where to be doing when we wanted to order our drinks. The quality of the food wasn't that great I would give it a 5/10. I had their brunch I'm not sure if their dinner is better. But I most likely won't be coming back.;BC, Canada;9;68;470;92;1;11

Yardbird;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/yardbird-washington-3?not_recommended_start=0;Vicent B.;5.0;10/15/2024;Returning to this spot for a second visit felt like rekindling an old flame--familiar, but with a modern twist. This restaurant has mastered the art of Southern comfort with a contemporary edge, making it a go-to for brunch or dinner. From shared plates to craft cocktails, every element of the dining experience is designed to keep you coming back.We kicked things off with an unusual appetizer choice--fried Brussels sprouts. I wasn't expecting much from the humble sprout, but wow, they were a game-changer. Perfectly crisp with just the right seasoning, they left us contemplating if they should be a permanent part of every meal.The star of the show, though, was the fried chicken. They've tweaked the way they serve it since our last visit. Gone are the mashed potatoes and salad that once accompanied the dish. Now, it's all about the chicken itself, and honestly, it doesn't need any extras. Juicy, flavorful, and fried to golden perfection, it's just as delicious as ever. That said, we opted for a side of French fries this time, which were good, but next time I might pair it with a refreshing salad to balance things out.I also had the pleasure of stopping by for lunch on a weekday during a conference in DC. Even with a party of seven, we were seated quickly, which was a nice surprise. The lunch menu is compact, but don't let that fool you--there's something for everyone. One of the highlights of the meal was the lobster mac n cheese. The presentation caught us off guard in the best way possible--it had a whimsical touch that made the entire table laugh. But don't let the playful appearance fool you;;;;;;;

Despite the restaurant being quite busy during lunchtime, the service we received was nothing short of stellar.We were lucky enough to be served by Lanita, who we later discovered is the general manager. Lanita's exceptional service truly made our visit memorable. She was attentive, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure we had a fantastic dining experience. It's rare to find such dedication and warmth in customer service, and Lanita certainly sets the bar high.Now, let's talk about the food - it was simply amazing!

So many flavors in one. We were very new to laos food but she made it all easy. She gave us other suggestions for next time to try. My gf love the decoration and bathroom. Overall, everything was great. I would ask for Lee again.;Washington, DC;0;2;661;132;0;0

I was fasting till 6pm but I arrived at 5:30pm. My server Lee was kind and chatted with me about the food. I told her I could not eat till 6 and she said dont worry, she would get the food on my table exactly at 6pm. And she did, it was really helpful. I got the rockfish and it was delicious. I never had rockfish like this before. The sauce was the best part, I put it over rice. I want to come back again soon and have the same exact thing!

My pals and I were seated ""enjoying"" our mediocre at best brunch, lunch whatever you want to call it, when all of a sudden some lady which I would guess would be the manager since I saw her early in the day doing managerial responsiblities, rolls by my table screaming obsenities ( including the f-bomb several times) at another person. My buds and I were trying to figure out if this was a customer or another employee or maybe even a personable matter since the person she was chasing screaming at had on plain clothes, not the black shirt and black apron as everyone else. The only reason why I gave them one star (besides the fact you have to) is I thought it was hilarious. I wasnt expecting a show along with my burger, but you should have seen the look at the lady at the booth next to me PRICELESS. I want to say I will be back even know the service was lacking and the food wasn't that good, because I can only hope to see another exciting event but if you let me down then its over...ha...but on a serious note someone needs to get that lady some manager's training and anger management classes!";Washington, DC;0;8;1267;244;1;0

It seems that when busy, the service is good, but when slow, the service is too. You would expect the opposite, but is just a weird thing about this place. Anyway, they have good food and one of my favorite places in Logan/DuPont. I can't want for the new place on 14th street to open.

From the moment I walked in, the service was warm, attentive, and genuinely welcoming.

The night before, I'd ordered their *Shrimp & Chicken Chorizo Pasta* through Uber Eats, but before the driver could pick it up, the restaurant had closed. Feeling frustrated but still hopeful, I decided to visit the restaurant the next day to explain what had happened.As soon as I walked in, the staff quickly reviewed my receipt. Joseph, who was at the counter, wasted no time in going directly to the management to sort out the issue. Not long after, Ms. Marissa came out of the kitchen with a warm smile and asked if I'd prefer a refund or a fresh order of what I'd originally chosen. While I waited, she even brought me a strawberry lemonade as a token of apology. It was such a thoughtful gesture, and I felt genuinely appreciated as a returning customer. This team of young professionals responded so swiftly and made it clear they were fully invested in my experience.The restaurant itself is beautiful, adorned with artwork from all over the world, including pieces that honor the Civil Rights Movement--a true delight to explore.

The tender and juicy chicken breast was perfectly seasoned with a hint of herbs and spices, and the melted cheese added a rich and creamy texture.The panini was expertly grilled, with a crispy crust that gave way to a soft and fluffy interior. The fresh lettuce and tomato added a burst of freshness, while the tangy aioli brought everything together. Each bite was a harmonious balance of flavors and textures that left me wanting more.What truly sets Busboys and Poets apart is the quality of their ingredients and the care with which they prepare each dish.If you're a fan of chicken paninis, or just looking for a delicious meal in a vibrant setting, do yourself a favor and head to Busboys and Poets.;Washington, DC;0;23;896;161;1;12

We came in January and absolutely hated. The food was better, the ambiance created by the music was groovy, and most of all, the management seemed present. Our order took quite some time to come out and we were about to say something but before we could, a manager named Johon came out and informed us that there was an error with their ordering system and that he had the food rushed. This is a vast improvement from our last visit where I food took 45 minutes and no manager ever came to greet us. We chatted for a bit about his cool tattoos and our food came out 5 minutes later. Shout out to Leyde our server. She was friendly! Keep them both. They're amazing!;Washington, DC;0;1;745;143;0;0

This was my second attempt to salvage any redeeming qualities from this establishment during a business trip, and I can confidently say it's a lost cause.Let's delve into the culinary disaster that awaited me. The pasta, or should I say ""pastor"" (if they were aiming for divine intervention in the kitchen), was a sad, mushy affair that left me questioning if they were even aiming for edible. The sauce? It was as flat as a pancake on a Sunday morning, devoid of any hint of creativity or flavor beyond a generic disappointment.But the horror show doesn't end there. The service was a comedy of errors, albeit not one I found particularly amusing. From botched orders to drinks spilled and staff who seemed to vanish into thin air, it was a masterclass in how not to run a restaurant.In summary, if you're in the market for an evening of culinary catastrophe and service so shoddy it borders on performance art, then the Red Hen is the place for you.

My reservation for 8 pm for two people was not only on time but seated right away upon arrival, which was a pleasant surprise. As someone who works in the industry, I often find myself waiting past my reservation time, but this was not the case here.Our server was incredibly attentive and quickly provided us with sparkling water. We started with the Arancini 'cacio E Pepe, and I must admit, I was a bit skeptical about ordering something fried. However, these risotto balls were a true delight. They were not only delicious but also neatly presented, with no hint of greasiness.Choosing our entrees was a tough decision since everything on the menu sounded fantastic. My girlfriend opted for the Mezzi Rigatoni Pasta, while I went with the Pappadelle Short Rib in Sugo Pasta . We both savored every bite and cleared our plates. The flavors and quality of the dishes were outstanding.To top off this wonderful experience, we were surprised with a complimentary cacio e pepe pasta, which isn't on the menu but can be requested. It was incredibly delicious, and I only wish I had more room in my stomach to enjoy the entire dish.Overall, our visit to the Red Hen was a solid 5/5 experience, and I can't wait to return.

I started off with the Duck Liver & Foie Gras Mousse and Roasted Fig appetizer, and it was absolutely delicious. The mousse was the star of the show - smooth, creamy, and packed with flavor. The fig added a nice sweetness and texture to the dish.For my main course, I had the Pappardelle alla Genovese and the Squid Ink Pasta. The Genovese was good, with tender chunks of short beef in a savory tomato-based sauce. The pasta was perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of bite. However, the Squid Ink Pasta was a little disappointing. While the pasta itself was cooked well and the squid was fresh and perfectly cooked, the dish was slightly too salty and had an unexpected taste of ginger, which seemed out of place. It was a shame because I could tell the pasta was made with care and high-quality ingredients.Despite the hiccup with the squid ink pasta, I still had a great dining experience at The Red Hen. The atmosphere was lively and fun, and the service was attentive and friendly. I would recommend the Duck Liver & Foie Gras Mousse and the Pappardelle alla Genovese.;Seattle, WA;1;15;1146;204;1;19

The Red Hen;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-red-hen-washington-4?not_recommended_start=80;Rajiv R.;5.0;2/24/2015;I have to say I'm pissed with The Red Hen. With one fell stroke The Red Hen ruined my blind date.She was pretty enough and I think I had a shot but picking the Red Hen as a date restaurant was a huge mistake, especially for someone like me. Whenever I like food I just get real quiet and eat my heart away, it is almost impossible for me to keep a conversation with anyone I am eating with. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY DATE. I ordered the Beef short ribs for both of us (horrible choice for date food, I know, yes it was very messy). The sauce that the Beef Ribs were covered in was stimulating to the point that I felt my tongue water whilst I ate. My date didn't eat as much as I, but she did say that she loved the taste. They had a great selection of drinks so I ordered some red wine hoping she wouldn't mind the fact that I wasn't talking much if she had some alcohol in her... it did not work.So yes, I enjoyed my food too much and I didn't enjoy my date enough. I really have to get this problem fixed, but for now, I won't be bringing any dates to The Red Hen. However, if you can enjoy food and company the same time though, this is a great place to try out.;Manassas, VA;10;6;1179;239;1;0

The Red Hen;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-red-hen-washington-4?not_recommended_start=80;K B.;5.0;10/18/2014;I've been here twice and I think that the food is truly exceptional. I'm going to run down most the things that I've tried here for anyone who's curious, but one thing to note is that EVERYTHING was great, so, even if I have areas that I might have liked differently, that might just be an issue of personal taste. Before going through everything, my high level favorites were:*Smoked Riccota Crostini*Heirloom Beet Salad*Saffron Zucca*Maple Custard (second place goes to the apple crumb cake, which was also awesome)Now, to the details!:*Smoked Ricotta Crostini. I thought that this was amazing. The portion is light (not small, just light). Our waiter recommended that we get this delivered with the desserts, which was nice. Very tasty, the honey and cheese is a great combination.*Tuscan Chicken Liver Crostini. I'm not a huge chicken liver fan, so wasn't my favorite, but one of my dining companions is a huge chicken liver fan and loved it. I mean, she said it was one of the best things that she's ever eaten and she's eaten at a lot of great places.*Heirloom Beet Salad. Loved it. I'm normally not a huge beet fan, but the beets were so fresh and I loved the pistachios and mozzarella. Really highly recommend.*Burrata with Grilled Broccolini. Burrata is one of my favorite things, so I was excited about this one, but honestly I thought that the extra components almost took away from the dish. This might be a personal taste thing, but I like burrata simple with some crusty bread.*Grilled octopus. Similar to the burrata, the octopus was perfectly cooked and incredibly delicious, but the extra sauces and components just took away from the octopus. Again, may be a personal taste issue, but our table all thought that the the same octopus with just some lemon and olive oil would have been better.*Saffron zucca with heirloom squash puree. Unbelievable, truly amazing. This might have been one of my favorite things that I've had all night, and in the city as a whole. The quality of the pasta...words don't describe, it's so good. I'm stuffed right now and my mouth still waters thinking about it. Close to perfect.*Spinach fettuccine with braised duck. Although very tasty, the saffron zucca was so incredible, that this one may not have been as appreciated as it should have been. The duck was great, but, again, I just couldn't stop eating the saffron zucca.*Mezze rigatoni. Again, very very tasty and the quality of the pasta was flawless. I still think that I liked the saffron zucca better (more interesting flavors and I love mushrooms), but the mezze rigatoni is a definite crowd pleaser.*Roasted spaghetti squash. I really really liked this. Very well cooked and I loved the hazelnuts on it. Really good, highly recommend, especially in the Fall.Now, I know that this is already too long, but I have to talk about the desserts for a second, because these are what take amazing to unbelievable holy god good. These desserts are why I often prefer to come here over other city faves such as Rose's Luxury:*Maple Custard with Caramelized Hazelnut. Yes. Just, yes. I've eaten a lot of food in a lot of amazing places. This is one of the best things that I've ever eaten. Ever. This is so amazing, I just don't even have words. This place is worth it if all it served was this custard.*Heirloom apple crumb cake. Really delicious, almost licked the plate. Although nothing will replace the maple custard in my heart, this is a close second.*Spiced pumpkin cake with chocolate sauce. Honestly, the cake was a little dry and I was a tad disappointed. HOWEVER, the ice cream with it was amazing. Coffee with chunks of chocolate, great flavor and texture.So, after this insanely long review, you need to come to Red Hen. Waits can be long, but I think sitting at the bar is more fun anyway. Remember to save room for dessert!;Chicago, IL;0;14;3881;662;0;0

While I had high expectations for the food, the dumplings were underwhelming. The filling lacked flavor, and the dough was a bit too thick, making them feel heavy.

On top of that, the service was slow, and we had to wait quite a while for our food despite the restaurant not being particularly busy.

I was embarrassed because it was my idea to come here. The service was terrible, with our waiter bringing flat sodas twice and disappearing for an extended period of time, leaving us with empty cups and no idea when he would return.To make matters worse, when the food finally arrived, it was cold, despite the plates being hot. This made me wonder if the food had been sitting out for a while before it was served. This was particularly frustrating as our group was observing Ramadan, and we were hoping for a hot, fresh meal to break our fast.Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The service was unacceptable, and the food was subpar at best. The bill was almost $300 and we only ate maybe half of the food if that.

Floriana;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/floriana-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Nancy Q.;1.0;4/24/2017;I booked a table a couple of weeks before a dinner. I was told that I can get a window seat on the first floor (which I get used to and which I usually like). I was also told, by a man, that there will be a large party on that day, but I was told very clearly that the party will be placed on the second floor and so would not affect me. On the day of arrival, to my disappointment, the girl who arranged our seat placed the large party on the first floor and us on the second floor, which was much worse in terms of decor etc. No window seat. And even more to my disappointment, there emerged another big party group on the second floor as well. There were plenty of good restaurants around DC, and the only reason I chose this one is I thought it would not be too loud. And I was totally wrong. When I was seated, there was no greetings from the waiter as they were so busy with the large parties.The food is bearable, but not outstanding. I guess a bad review is not so much loss to them compared to big parties or groups which can bring them much money.

Floriana;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/floriana-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Lawrence W.;4.0;02/07/2024;Floriana is a reliable choice for quality food and drinks. Housed in a converted townhouse, the restaurant exudes a rustic charm with its old-fashioned appeal. Despite some quirks like exposed A/C units and crooked paintings, the overall ambiance is welcoming.While the cocktail menu isn't particularly unique, it offers a good range of options. I tried a cucumber vodka drink, which was refreshingly sweet. We kicked off our meal with a surprisingly hearty octopus appetizer (highly recommended). For the main course, my date thoroughly enjoyed the lamb gnocchi, while I savored the eggplant tagliatelle, which, though not extraordinary, was delicious. I would definitely suggest Floriana as an intimate date spot, and I look forward to returning.;Northwest Washington, Washington, DC;18;21;748;115;1;1
Floriana;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/floriana-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Ryan Y.;4.0;04/01/2018;Visited Floriana with my boss and a few colleagues this past Monday when our res at another restaurant fell through. The hostess greeted us warmly and despite having no reservation the were able to accommodate us within 30 minutes. We were directed downstairs to the bar to have a drink while we waited. Cozy, warm, friendly and funny bartender. Two of us had the house Manhattan. Amazing. We went upstairs and had a truly satisfying dinner. I ordered the chicken and was happy to discover that it is plentiful and full of flavor. Chicken isn't necessarily a fall dish but the seasoning had the taste of the season. My boss asked our server for a recommendation and he got the lasagna. I've never seen him happier. We finished up and took pics in front of the tree. Found out later that every year they do a theme tree and this year they celebrated the new Disney movie Coco about the Catholic holiday of the Day of the dead. Two of our party are of Latin American decent and they explained that this tree was one of the most creative and beautiful trees they have seen;Fairfax, VA;1;7;1069;195;1;0

Homemade gnocchi with wild boar and pea risotto were both well done. The servers were equally impressive. My first glass was a little dirty (not lipstick stained dirty, just water spot dirty) and our waiter comped my wine. Very classy, sir. The intimacy of the resto is also incredibly cute. It is in a house, so you definitely get that cozy feeling. But, it may not conducive to two gals trying to grab dinner/drinks post work. We weren't trying to get turned up or anything, but I laughed loudly once and felt far too rowdy for the crowd. No one judged me, though, so more points for this place. I think it's a cool spot generally but would particularly recommend it for a date or romantic outing, the couples seemed to be in their element.;Washington, DC;53;130;777;141;1;1

Bat, the owner, shared with us the secret behind their exquisite pasta dishes--freshly made pasta crafted daily by a seasoned artisan who has dedicated years to perfecting her craft.The gnocchi was sublime, and the ravioli was impeccable.

We were able to tell him that as he took the time, though obviously busy, for an informative and entertaining visit to the table. Every item was perfectly seasoned and came out in a timely way. The omelettes had the consistency of luxurious pillows, the polenta was exquisitely prepared, and the lasagna, obviously handmade, has become our new all-time benchmark for the dish.   The service was 100% attentive, anticipating all of our needs without having to be prompted. Totally friendly, yet non-intrusive and professional.

The bartender, Brandon, was telling a customer (who spoke English as a second language, thats the only reason I can come up with for him not catching this) what beers he had on tap. After naming a couple he got to Negro Modelo. Except he said n****r Modelo instead. TWICE. I definitely heard it and when I snapped my head toward my friend, she and I locked eyes because she heard it too. We had already paid and were about to leave. We were both shocked, I think thats why neither of us said anything in the moment. We stepped outside and talked about it for a couple minutes before I decided to go in and say something to the racist bartender Brandon. I pulled him aside and told him I heard what he said, both times and that it was disgusting and never ok. He denied it, with a smirk. Instead of punching him in the face like I wanted to, I told him he better watch his enunciation of his words because if someone else had heard his use such a foul hateful word, he'd get his ass beat. This is unacceptable. I will not be going back to Tico and I encourage them to fire this racist Brandon guy before he gets the whole place in trouble.

At some point during the night, the bar area started smelling like marijuana. We starting looking at other customers trying to figure out who was ruining the night. Before we knew it, out of nowhere, the manager came up to us. I thought he was going to apologize for the smell and say something along the lines of ""I'm sorry for the smell. We're trying to pinpoint where it's coming from and it'll be dealt with swiftly."" Boy was I wrong! Instead, he came up to us to accuse us of smoking weed! We were all shocked. He hadn't approached other customers at the bar so I'm left with the only explanation that we were profiled, since we were the only black people at the bar.

I wish there is a zero star to show how disappointed I am. My friends and I (around 20 people) went for a happy hour on Thursday for the first time. From the beginning, customer service was very unpleasant. We couldn't even be able to order a single drink and whenever we wave our hand they just pass us pretending they didn't see us. After we got a drink almost begging, we started our conversation with each other trying to have fun. Around 10PM the manager came to one of our friend and accused him smoking marijuana. He replied He didn't and asked him to check with the rest of the folks in the restaurant to see if they smoking weed then he said ""I don't like the way you are looking at me I need you to leave"". All we were doing was trying to have good decent time there but apparently they were looking for a reason to kick us out. I will say this again, very very bad customer service and poor managemen!!!!!";Alexandria, VA;0;3;975;187;0;0
Tico DC;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/tico-dc-washington-2?not_recommended_start=0;Sara T.;1.0;1/13/2017;Big space. Mediocre food. Horrible service. About 20 of us met up there for food, drinks, and a bit of chatter. Started out ok, but minutes into the evening, everything went south. Servers showed zero respect and began to treat us with a poor, tasteless attitude. Hours into the night, a Marijuana scent broke out and spread fast at the bar, WHERE MANY OTHER PEOPLE WERE THERE, but for some unknown reason, they targeted our circle and accused us of smoking Marijuana inside the restaurant- without any evidence. The place had their lights on bright enough to see the smoke itself, so if it was us who smoked, it would've been very apparent, but they didn't care. They weren't even happy with us from the jump-start. Given that there were a lot of people there, it would've been kind gesture to have asked around first before accusing us of something we had nothing to do with. So it's safe to say that we will never go there again. Not worth spending our hard earned money there.;Alexandria, VA;200;1;980;176;1;0

Tico DC;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/tico-dc-washington-2?not_recommended_start=10;R V.;3.0;1/13/2017;I've been to Tico four times now. The first two were wonderful - the food was excellent, the margaritas were delicious, they modified dishes for me to make them vegetarian without any problem, and the service was friendly and attentive. The last two times have been a different story. The servers are still friendly, but they disappear after taking your order because food is brought out by food runners, and there seems to be no communication between wait staff and the people bringing out food. When I went in for brunch a few months ago, the open-faced omelet I got was so dry that it was inedible. I ordered a breakfast burrito instead, without chorizo, and the one that came out had chorizo in it. My friend's food got cold while he was waiting for mine to come out. The last time I went in for dinner, I ate half of a dish that I had specifically ordered without bacon before I realized it had bacon in it. When I was able to get the attention of the server and tell him, he took the dish away without asking if I wanted to order anything else. Several minutes later, a food runner brought a version of the dish without bacon to the very confused women at the table next to mine. Our server eventually realized the mistake and brought another bacon-free dish out to me, but at that point I didn't want anything and just wanted to leave. I asked for more water, after having finished both my water and my friend's water, but I never got any. The drinks and food (when prepared as ordered) are usually really delicious, but if you have serious dietary restrictions, I wouldn't rely on Tico to modify dishes for you. I might end up back there if I'm in the neighborhood, but I would only order dishes exactly as they are on the menu from now on.;Washington, DC;0;7;1748;324;1;0

Tico DC;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/tico-dc-washington-2?not_recommended_start=40;Sean B.;5.0;03/06/2015;I'm torn between giving Tico 4 and 5 stars. Since some of its food is 5 stars worthy, and we had great service, I'll round up to 5. I try to avoid small plate restaurants, but every time I walk by this place, it's packed, so I decided to see if its popularity was due to its food. That seems to be the case, at least based on my 1 experience. 5 stars worthy:1. The mac and cheese. Not too heavy, and a nice twist on a common American dish. 2. The bittersweet chocolate tart with vanilla ice cream. It was just the right balance of sweetness and biterness. And the serving size was just right too. 3. The service. Very efficient and friendly. And while my mom and I did not ask the waitress for her advice on the menu, the advice she and another waiter gave a couple other tables seemed legit (they both hyped the mac and cheese plus a couple other dishes I see yelpers have realy liked). 4 stars worthy:1. The lamb meatballs. A bit bland, but the tomato sauce was pretty good. If the meatballs had a little more seasoning, this could be 5 stars.2. The roasted pork tacos. The pork itself was pretty good. I think there might have been too much stuff in the tacos though. 3. The drink list. Wide variety of options. My cocktail (the ponyboy? something with bourbon in it) wasn't bad. My mom was content with her glass of pinot grigio. 3 stars worthy:The fried calamari. Its sauce was very ordinary. We regretted ordering this, especially when all the other food was much, much better. Overall, a really good place. I would advise reading through the reviews on yelp to get an idea of what Tico's best dishes are since it seems at least a few are pretty ordinary and not worth the cost (such as the aforementioned calamari).;Oakland, CA;125;1166;1722;321;1;76

Crispy, but chewy and the perfect vessel for generous portions of real pepperoni. This was also the first time I had ever had honey on a pizza... but it somehow works to compliment the spicy meat. For dessert, we took our waiter up on trying the cheesecake.

However, feels like it should be just a LITTLE less expensive, and a little less hyped, and it would be such a staple. As-is, I think it's punching just a little bit above it's weight, and as such we feel we're glad we went, but wouldn't necessarily come back. A Delicious meal, but not quite worth the money we paid.The vibe of the restaurant is great - open kitchen with a huge hearth fire. I wish we were sat closer to it! Casual dress, anything from a suit w/o tie to nice shorts would be fine to wear. We walked in at 8pm on a Tuesday and were sat in about 40 minutes.The hearth-roasted vegetables were the only super large standout. They were like no vegetables we've ever eaten. Fresh, flavorful, roasted perfectly by the file - delicious! Other highlights were the kohlrabi salad (great flavors together) the hush puppies (another favorite - but how can you go wrong!) the sweet potato fried catfish roll (again - how could you go wrong with fried fish on a sweet roll).The menu is known to change daily with what's fresh.We also got the fried sugar toads (sweet fried fish) and fried softshell crab. Our fault that we ordered too much fried seafood - should have done that better. Those two dishes were fine... but in the end tasted like fried fish! There's only so much you can do with those.I think because of the fried food we filled up too early and didn't grab desert - which looked amazing, but we simply didn't have room. The server suggested ""2-3 small plates"" per person, but we got 2 snacks and 4 small plates for two, and were STUFFED. So, take that for what you will.";Manhattan, NY;563;21;1644;300;1;6

Balsamic is often hit or miss. I like that they've switched to ""winter spices"" now.The little things were impressive too -- the bread and butter was MONEY. Bourbon Brown Sugar Sundae for dessert was perfect. If only we could have ordered our favorite local kombucha, Blue Ridge Bucha, as a digestif --- THAT would have been the ultimate final touch to a wonderful evening.Best of all, the costs weren't unreasonably high and they didn't require you to pay a flat rate as some other fine dining restaurants ask (see: Pineapple & Pearls).

After placing my order, I waited for an hour and a half with no updates or explanation about the delay. When I finally decided to request a refund, the cashier was shockingly rude and dismissive. She didn't offer any apology or attempt to address the situation, nor did a manager step in to acknowledge or resolve the poor service. It was clear that customer satisfaction wasn't a priority. What made the experience even worse was watching at least 20 DoorDash drivers come and go, picking up orders without any issues. Meanwhile, my order--and that of others who were dining in--was completely ignored. It's frustrating to sit at a table in the restaurant, only to see that delivery orders are given priority over the customers who actually took the time to visit the establishment. I understand that there's no table service here, but that's no excuse for neglecting in-store customers while catering almost exclusively to delivery services. It felt like they didn't value our business at all. The lack of professionalism, poor customer service, and blatant prioritization of delivery orders over dine-in customers made this experience a complete waste of time and money. I will never go back, and I would strongly advise others to think twice before visiting. Good luck if you decide to give this place a try--you'll need it.;Washington, DC;0;1;1444;241;0;0

I am a Southern-born chef who grew up in the business and when you have grits on the menu, you really need to show out to hold my attention. I ordered oxtails with grits.

Modena;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/modena-washington-2?not_recommended_start=0;K V.;1.0;4/15/2023;The desserts are an embarrassing disaster: just don't bother. So I waited 1-and-a-half hours this evening to speak to the pastry chef - but he couldn't be bothered to come talk to me. So instead, here are my thoughts (and the un-diplomatic version):I had the parmesan cake and balsamic ice-cream. Why bother? What's the point? It had zero taste. The cake didn't taste of parmesan, and the gelato didn't taste of balsamic. If you are going to do something innovative like this (which you should), then have the 'cojones' to go for it properly. Don't do it half-arsed. But it's not just this dessert: all of the desserts that I have tried have been a confused, half-hearted miss. The tiramisu isn't tiramisu - it's cheesecake. So call it cheesecake, because otherwise you're treating people like dummies (i.e. you think they're too parochial to know what tiramisu actually is, and the difference between cheesecake and tiramisu !**?!!?!). I'm all for innovating the classics, but turning a tiramisu into a totally different (bog standard) dessert, shows that you (i.e. the pastry chef) are really confused and have nothing original to say. Etc, etc, re the other desserts. Either give the diner's palate something to think about (a clearly-articulated, well-executed concept), or just quit pretending that you know what you're doing.So, I don't know if there is a pastry chef as such, or whether the chef is responsible for this car-crash of a dessert offering, but either stop it, or do it properly. You can always measure the worth of a restaurant by its dessert list, and this dessert offering is simply embarrassing.;Midtown East, New York, NY;0;1;1620;270;0;0

You could tell the staff were working hard and they deserve every bit of that 22% service charge. My server popped by to let me know she'd be with me shortly as it was very busy. That gave us some time to look over the menu. I had the shrubmosa and a golden milk latte. They both were packed with flavor. It was so busy I watched the barista herself bring me my coffee drink to ensure it got to me while it was hot. The hostesses would walk around to help refill drinks, clean and set up tables. Again, the team work deserves an A+ rating. My server made my health her top priority by making sure my allergies were addressed and I loved that. She made some great recommendations and I ended up getting the bakers basket to start then the sausage Benedict as my entree. They were delicious!

The restaurant has a ton of vegetarian dishes, like the ""not your mom's green bean casserole"" (green beans, mushroom, sous vide egg) and goat & butter veg (whipped salted goat butter, basil blossoms, micro mint, peppercorn medley, asparagus, snap peas).

Bistrot Du Coin;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/bistrot-du-coin-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Sean L.;3.0;12/08/2024;Bistrot Du Coin once held a special place in my heart, my go-to spot for authentic, comforting French cuisine since moving to the area in 1998. From leisurely lunches to indulgent dinners, I savored their French Onion Soup, which I considered among the finest in the DMV. Their escargot, foie gras, duck confit, beef bourguignon, seafood ravioli, and Mont Blanc--all were staples of my dining repertoire. Sadly, those cherished memories now feel like distant echoes. Returning for the first time since pre-COVID, I had high hopes. Yet, this weekend lunch visit left me deeply disappointed. The hallmark flavors that once defined Bistrot Du Coin seem to have vanished entirely. Whether it's a change in ownership or a shift in the kitchen team, the magic is undeniably gone. The French Onion Soup, once a shining example of its kind, now tastes flat and unremarkable. The Complete Omelette, equally disheartening, was bland and utterly forgettable. The one saving grace of the meal was the Au Pistou Mussel Pot--mussels in a fragrant basil and garlic sauce with prosciutto and French ham--that managed to retain the standard I once adored. Even so, it wasn't enough to salvage the experience. As I reflect on this visit, I can't help but debate: should I give their full dinner menu one last chance to rekindle the magic, or is it time to bid farewell to a once-beloved institution? For now, my disappointment weighs heavy, and my return feels uncertain.;McLean, VA;123;237;1456;242;1;7747

I've never exactly been to a strictly 'French' restaurant before, and that just screamed fancy and pricey to me. Me and my wife came in a few nights ago, our reservation was for two at 8:45 pm. I walked in and the ambiance hit me with all kinds of pleasant smells and a general sense of easy goingness. I was looking forward to dining some immaculate food, but in all honesty the quality just wasn't there. The food here was incredible by all means, but I thought that it should've been more extraordinary, especially for those prices. If you do plan on coming here and aren't a vegetarian, I suggest the le-steak maison.

The mussel pots and the snails are also good bets.Decent wine list, with plenty of reasonably-priced options. The house red is actually rather good.The place gets very busy, which is a good sign, so get there early or be prepared to wait around for a while.

Great Yelp reviews, and the Dupont location, led us here. Cute, somewhat cozy, and informal, and our table was at a window overlooking the street. Very nice, and I like this better than fancy and snooty.Most importantly, the food was really wonderful...mostly. we had escargot (my first time), and it was just awesome, down to the last drop of butter soaked into our bread. The birthday girl was thrilled with them, along with the Foie gras. The large bucket of mussels was really, really amazing, we could have gone through another one! We also had a beef noodle dish (forget the name), and it was pretty good.Bottom line--Pros:Nice place. Nice service (really, even though I've read differently on here). Very good food. Great value. Mussels and escargotCons:A little loud. A little cold. A little smoky (not sure why). Bread only ok.

For Dinner (came in at 6-7 pm on the weekend): Very crowded place with all kinds of people. It's right on the strip on restaurants on Connecticut Ave so it's a given that it'll be a tourist spot to try in Dupont Circle when visiting D.C. The atmosphere is loud and social, fine dining without the awkward silence. You kinda have to scream at each other to talk. Waiting list was confusing, there's just a scatter of people from the door to the the bar area and no one knows who's been helped or not. The hostess tend to disappear a lot so you had to hunt her down and check up a few times to make sure she didn't miss you. Towards the end of the night, the manager came out to help, it was a good thing she was there because she took notice of who was who. It a big restaurant and they don't waste any space. There's also an upstairs balcony where they fit about 50 people, it was quite hard to move around. None the less, they were very accommodating and apologetic to the long wait. Appetizers- French Onion soup: came out with the cheese still boiling and wonderufl aroma of caramelized onions. Perfect to taste;;;;;;;

Bistrot Du Coin;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/bistrot-du-coin-washington?not_recommended_start=50;Brian C.;4.0;4/13/2009;Since coming to D.C. at the end of March, I have eaten at Bistrot Du Coin twice: Once by myself for late lunch and once for a dinner with my sister from New York. Based on both visits, I have to say that this French bistro is one of the better places to eat at Dupont Circle. The Good: The food tastes great and the portions are filling. The French Onion Soup is perfectly made and not too salty, the Steak Frites are decent but the portion is large and the Bearnaise sauce it comes with tastes great with the fries, the Duck and Monkfish entrees at dinner tasted excellent but both came in thick cream sauces (so don't order if you don't like cream). The mussels are as good as people say they are, a small pot of mussels can serve as a good appetizer for two hungry people. The Bad: The restaurant can get loud and packed during dinner time. The service is great and attentive during their late lunch hours (after 2pm), but it can get spotty during dinner service. Without reservations, it can take an hour to get seated for dinner. Bottom line: the food is excellent and filling, but pricey;;;;;;;

The steak was cooked to perfection, and the variety of options made it even better. The escargot had a wonderful balance of flavors, and the garlic and herbs really shone through. The fries were tasty, and the chocolate mousse was a delightful ending to the meal. The service was efficient, considering how busy they were.

That was an all around superb dining experience and the food was no less than outstanding. Bistrot Du Coin serves real French fare and has reasonable prices and a fully unpretentious and inviting atmosphere. That's not a combination you'll see very often and I was blown away. I started off with the baked mussels in garlic butter and ordered the rabbit stew for dinner. Seriously, straight out of France. You could honestly swear that you were there. The rabbit stew somehow pulled off a magic trick of being rich and delicious and yet lean and rustic at the same time. You know a restaurant is good when it looks packed and that was exactly correct here. Bravo.;Washington, DC;0;9;709;125;1;0

What was the first thing that popped into my head? Steak. Steak in a rich sauce. Where could one find such a thing? Bistro du Coin of course! If you want to become a fat ass (or consume as many calories as you just burned while doing a marathon), I highly recommend getting one of their steaks. If the meat won't fill you up, the rich sauce certainly will. To ensure you feel like a true glutton, they have fries on the side too (which are, eh, not bad but not nearly as good as the steak and its sauce). Of course Bistro du Coin has other options beyond steak. The mussels are also fantastic and a friend raved about the duck he had.It took me nearly 2 years of living in DC to finally come to Bistro Du Coin, but I finally got around to it and have now gone twice within a month. Definitely recommend eating here.Oh, the beer selection is :meh: but it does have an extensive wine selection. I don't recommend getting the cheaper bottles, they kinda suck (but hey, I guess that's just more proof you get what you pay for).;Oakland, CA;125;1166;1128;213;1;76

I will say that the tasting menu without any additions is enough to fill you up, we were really struggling by the time the pressed duck came around. Only reason for 4 stars was the scallop dish and the bread that came with the wagyu. The scallops were so salty that we could barely eat them and that took us a bit out of the immersion of the meal. Bread was incredibly dry but the butter was really good! All-in-all, I would certainly come back for another experience.;New York, NY;155;5;608;117;1;2

I really enjoyed the vibe inside here, the interior is cozy with a minimalist touch that makes it super sleek. I thought it would be expensive when coming in here because it looks very high class, but the prices aren't scary at all. The food is top quality, but there aren't many extraordinary dishes that would stand out, I've seen most of the menu in other spots around DC before. The chestnut agnolotti was definitely the standout dish of the night, it came with rabbit, sunchokes, mustard seed and pear that made for a wild yet enjoyable flavor. The pacing of the dishes was somewhat slow, every dish came out in intervals of almost 30 minutes. Still, I don't think this is by any means a 'bad' place, it just needs a few minor adjustments here and there.;Washington, DC;0;1;901;164;0;0

The delicate slices of fish melted in my mouth, each bite a harmonious blend of freshness and subtle seasoning. It set a high bar for the courses to follow.Next, I was served the lamb saddle, which, without a doubt, was the highlight of the evening. The lamb was perfectly cooked, tender, and bursting with rich, savory flavors that lingered long after the last bite.

He refused to allow me to do that at my table, but If I wanted he would reseat me across the restaurant at a table by MYSELF so i could be charged a different price and chose what I selected without paying for the unlimited brunch.

Each plate was delicious, showcasing bold flavors and expert preparation. I highly recommend the Anadolu Manti -- these dumplings were amazing. The small plate style is perfect for sharing, and I'd recommend ordering about three dishes per person to fully explore the menu. The Pistachio SoufflÃ© for dessert was perfect--light, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The service was exceptional. Our waiter was attentive, knowledgeable, and offered thoughtful recommendations that truly elevated our experience. To top it all off, the decor and ambiance created a warm and inviting atmosphere, making it a great spot for a memorable evening out.**I will say, this restaurant automatically adds a 3% surcharge to all checks. This does not take the place of gratuity, and is explained as a way for the restaurant to keep up with increasing expenses, etc.. While the check notes that you can request the removal of this surcharge, I really don't like this and wish they would simply raise the cost of each menu item. The cost listed on the menu should be the cost of the meal, rather than a 3% higher surprise once you've completed your meal.**;Cheverly, MD;4;35;1436;230;1;83

The starters were delicious, especially the smoked salmon, and the entrees, like the fried egg over lamb, were the stars of the show.

Our waiter, Brent, was attentive and helpful and didn't roll his eyes when we ordered practically everything on the menu and eventually abandoned mimosas for straight champagne and liquor). We were there for almost 3 hours, eating and drinking as we pleased, and he was happy to continue to serve us.Some of the best dishes I tasted: cacik, htipiti, arugula salad, manchego/tomato/basil omelette, and really all of the flatbreads.Agora's prix fixe brunch is a great choice if you're looking for a booze-heavy marathon brunch with awesome food!;Washington D.C., DC;4;6;842;145;0;0

A large room packed like sardines with man-bun wearing bearded poseurs and their ironic tattoos. If you want to talk to your dining companions as we did you can forget it. NOTHING to deaden the cacophony...no carpet, no acoustic ceiling, nothing. This must rank as one of the loudest places on the face of the earth. The floor appeared as if it had not been swept since the Carter administration. The food...if it ever arrives...is mediocre and way, way overpriced. The service is the worst I have ever experienced. Snotty, pretentious and most of all...incompetent. Water glasses were never refilled, and one of our party had an entree delivered AFTER THE REST OF US HAD FINISHED OUR ENTIRE MEAL. They will nickle-and-dime you to death. One of our party ordered sliders, and asked for pickles, which did not come with them. They charged a dollar extra for five slices of pickle from a commercial jar. I don't like spicy food, so I wanted a mild cheese on my burger instead of the Pepper-jack. They charged extra for the substitution...one slice of cheese for another. I needed to use the bathroom, which had only one stall. After several unsuccessful attempts to find it vacant, I saw that they had an unoccupied handicap-accessible bathroom. They refused to let me use it, even though by this time it was quite the emergency. Finally the manager reluctantly (and she let me know it was reluctantly) called off the two nasty servers whose job it is...apparently...to police the toilets and allowed me to use it. Handicap-accessible does not mean handicap only, but these unpleasant amateurs are unclear on the concept. So if you want to be VERY badly treated while chowing down on very expensive so-so food (if it ever arrives)...this is the place for you.;Oxon Hill-Glassmanor, MD;5;3;1792;309;1;4

From the ambiance, to the mission statement, the bookstore element and selection, as well as the diverse staff working. As a vegan, I'm thrilled at the wide array of options. Unfortunately, however, I've been consistently disappointed with the quality of food (especially whilst considering the price point.) The entrees I've had, like the Polenta and Mediterranean pasta, have consistently been too oily to truly enjoy. The tempeh sandwich was too salty, the vegan chx one was dry as a nun ( or however the saying goes I don't know but I went home and added a glob of my own sauces just so it wouldn't go to waste.) Tuna salad sandwich (v) was okay, not really flavorful but solid texture and made for a light meal... Nothing really to write home about or compel me to come back and try again. And believe me, I've been trying! Something new every time. Have yet to really my clean plate or even take leftovers consistently, which is atypical of me to say THE LEAST (Don't believe the hype of vegan-means-healthy. This vegan likes to throw DOWN.) Anyway, I wrote this review because of how absolutely friggin' AWFUL my service was the last visit. My friend and I are both over five eleven respectively, and were seated at a 2-top corner table was half booth facing window with nothing to bare ones back upon.Okay, I'm young and able bodied, not a deal breaker, but having to sideways scoot your body to be seated while whether making eye or ass contact with the adjacent table is awkward and uncomfortable af to say the LEAST. The drinks we ordered took about 20 minutes to hit the table and were quite underwhelming when they did, in flavor as well as liquor. Our server, ""Hollywood"" was unironically so curt in both tone and demeanor the entire meal. Being a food service vet myself I try never to take anything personally but I thought perhaps our demographic may have played a role due to the blatant attitude despite us both making a point to be polite and compassionate. I would've gotten another round of drinks but we were both so disappointed with the service that we decided to cut out early. When another table was seated, however, I noticed they too waited exceptionally long to be served and were visibly annoyed-- so much so, another server swung by to check on them. Truthfully, I feel petty even mentioning it but the only time I had a pleasant interaction was once the check came when I asked her how she was feeling and how long she's been working (which she misunderstood and said 4pm, I was trying to see if she was just new.) Anyway, it was nice to see her actually smile and take on a tone that was semi-pleasant and make eye contact for the very first time... this place, and that server, have excellent potential (please just give her some gentle coaching and maybe hire bussers/bar & like runners to help smooth the flow of busy nights) I won't be back for a while though... being the hopeless sentimentalist I am though I'll probably try another location in a few months once the terrible taste in my mouth subsides.";San Francisco, CA;0;1;3088;549;0;0

But this review is for the chef. I ordered a salmon salad for pick up and once I got back to work I noticed that my salmon was rare on the inside. I even accidentally ate it. I called and the manager issued me another salmon. When I went to pick it up she told me that the chef cooks all of his salmon RARE unless you request otherwise. First, what?? So he cooks SUSHI when you order salmon. Instead of cooking it medium well he makes it RARE in the middle.. it is despicable. So that is not really the reason for this rating. When I opened the box to eat my new salmon it was charred and dry. So if a customer DOES NOT want to eat RARE salmon for lunch the only option at this location is dry tasteless salmon. He did not even season it well. So customers are punished for sending back rare fish. Teds Bulletin makes normal salmon and I NEVER have to remind them to not make it RARE. What chef doesnt know how to cook salmon? He can only make rare or well done/dry. I am not even a chef and I know how to cook salmon so it is juicy, and cooked all the way. The manager was super sweet and the customer service was incredible! The chef's attempt to over correct or punish me was tacky and petty.;Washington, DC;0;13;1247;249;0;0

We were told that bus boys and poets is owned by the same people so us having such a great experience at Eatonville we decided to go. What a mistake-- the atmosphere was great service awesome food was awful. The fried chicken is not really fried chicken. My wife is a die hard vegetarian and she almost considered ordering a Big Mac from Mickey D's. The Cauliflower frittata was a combination of bland and hot sick ass. The vegan crab-cake is something that makes me want to go kill and eat a real crab. The Hummus was decent but nothing to write home about it tasted like something that was packaged and served. The nachos were ok i prefer a black bean though and the shrimp cake was under done which even the waitress commented on and sent back. She said that our food looked different than usual.When i spoke to ken or ren or something like that (the Black guy behind the desk- i think he was the manager) he told me that they were short staffed and apologized. He did take the crab cake off the menu which i was not going to pay for anyway. The only reason he did was because i started to get agitated. I understand you're short staffed but does that mean i get half a check?? In other words stick to Eatonville unless your looking for a fun night out of fasting.Note: At Eatonville i bumped into owner which i told entire story to and he said he would get to the bottom of it and call me on Monday BUT that was month ago.

I came here for breakfast when there was no wait, but I can't imagine you'd ever have to wait long here due to the large amount of tables. But if you do, there's plenty of books to keep you busy.The breakfast was pretty good. Nothing extraordinary, but overall decent. My omelette was tasty and I loved the bread they use for toast (pretty thick) but I couldn't eat the homefries. They were just swimming in oil. I wanted a side of bacon instead of the homefries to begin with, but when I asked, the waiter just shook his head no. I wasn't even given the option to sub it out and still pay full price for the side of bacon, I was just told no. I guess the customer isn't their priority.Just a heads up that this place does do takeout, but apparently not for brunch. I waited for them to open one morning to grab takeout only to find out they don't do it for brunch. So, plan accordingly.;Washington, DC;0;18;943;180;1;0

Unfortunately, I did find the whole atmosphere tainted a little by the place looking like it was trying too hard to be cool. For example, all that shiny metal, glass, and black leather covered seating just seemed more appropriate for a mod bar and to clash with the idea of the self-described ""progressive"" bookstore. Maybe it's my left-coast-defined preferences of cafes, and B&P is not just a cafe...

I really like this place. The food was excellent and everyone who works here couldn't have been nicer. I'm not a poet and honestly I'm not much of an artsy super reader, but you really don't have to be here. All types of folks who enjoy a relaxing warm atmosphere with good food are here. I might just have to hold back a star because it can be a little crowded. A lot of folks with their laptop and a coffee park it for quite a while at regular seating tables. Maybe if there was a separate, non-eating area for such things. There may have been one? Didn't see it though. However, an excellent set-up. I will absolutely make it a regular.;Washington, DC;0;9;666;124;1;0

Visited DC for the March for Jobs and Justice rally, and had been referred to this place to grab a bite to eat. The food is delicious and you get great portions for your buck. Being the creative artsy person that I am, this place was right up my ally. Its very bohemian, hipster, skinny jeans and geek glasses if you know what I mean. They have different events throughout the week such as slam poetry, book readings, etc. They have a few locations in dc as well as one in hyatsville md which is one that I venture to the most.

The food, service, and ambiance are all exceptional. Today's dinner was no different. The food was excellent, delicious, and did not disappoint as usual. However, what made tonight's meal exceptional was an ingredient not on the menu. That ingredient was our stellar server Eric L. Eric was personable, professional, and knowledgeable. His insight and suggestions for our meals were spot on from the appetizers to the entrees, to the drinks and desserts. Eric is a keeper! Give him a raise and paid vacation. I repeat Eric is a keeper! Finances allowing I would dine at Bus Boys and Poets daily if Eric could be my server. My name is Baba-C and I approved this review.;Silver Spring, MD;0;1;746;128;0;0

The establishment has cultivated a culture that not only prioritizes culinary excellence but also fosters genuine connections between staff and patrons. Recent interactions with team members Darryl, Prince, Gen, Jordan, and Ki have reinforced my belief that investing in this restaurant could yield significant returns--not merely financially but also socially.Darryl's creation of the best ""self-care"" drink exemplifies how attentive service can elevate a dining experience from ordinary to extraordinary. His passion for crafting beverages that promote wellness resonates deeply with health-conscious consumers today. Similarly, Prince's thoughtful gesture of bringing the ""immunity"" drink directly to my table illustrates an understanding of customer needs that transcends transactional interactions. Such personalized service not only enhances the dining atmosphere but also establishes loyalty among patrons who feel valued.Moreover, Ki's remarkable service and authentic conversation provided me with a sense of peace during my visit--an invaluable quality in today's fast-paced world. This level of engagement creates lasting memories and encourages customers to share their experiences within their social circles. My enthusiastic recommendations have already prompted friends to visit Busboys and Poets, suggesting that the impact of exemplary service extends far beyond individual transactions.Given these experiences, one must consider whether investing in Busboys and Poets is a prudent choice. The combination of stellar service personnel like Darryl, Prince, Gen, Jordan, and Ki creates an environment ripe for growth and profitability while enriching community connections--a dual benefit worth pursuing.";Washington, DC;0;6;1927;265;0;0

I'm a mother of 3 kids,I lost my husband 2years ago. He left me and my kids with a lot of debts, student loans, medical bills, tax liens and evictions. The little business I was managing to help my family with was going down, so I called my sister who lives in North Carolina, she introduced me to this Credit Specialist. He did a wonderful job on my credit report. I was amazed when I saw how everything reflected on my profile perfectly. He wiped out the bad items off my report and also loaded my account with $18,000. I got a high score of 786 with a good credit limit. This is all I can say about him compared to other good reviews I read about him on the internet. I will also refer him to anyone out there who is in need of his services. Kindly contact him on REMOTE REPAIR at CLERK dot COM;Alexandria, VA;0;4;893;172;0;0

I went with a group of friends one evening and it was packed. Always a good sign. We decided to wait because we had heard so many good things, and can I just say, definitely worth the wait. The food, the service, and the atmosphere were all amazing. I would suggest the crab fritters to start. It comes the 4 lightly fried balls filled with crab meat, shrimp and risotto in a lobster sauce. Delicious. I would also suggest the salmon entree which comes with asparagus and wild rice as well as a lemon butter cream sauce to top it all off. My friends were all extremely satisfied as well with their appetizers, entrees and desserts. I will definitely be returning on my next visit to the city!

They play great music, nice seats, and very green. They have happy staff, and the vibe is very trendy, but yet simple. I love it! One of my top 10 restaurants.;Washington, DC;0;3;484;96;0;0

Maiz 64;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/maiz-64-washington-2?not_recommended_start=0;Taylor B.;2.0;2/14/2022;Sigh - another bad experience on 14th street again. I was really excited about this place since so many reviews hold it in such a high regard. However, definitely some things need to be figured out when it comes to service. My partner and I made reservations for the Mezcal Room for Valentine's Day. We arrived on time, along with 4 other parties, only to realize that they were running 30-60 min behind on reservations. This would have been a nice fact to note when we arrived, but instead we found out after spending an hour waiting. We really only came for one to two drinks in the mezcal room but ended up having half of a drink at the upstairs bar with every other couple who was also waiting for their reserved tables.Usually I don't mind waiting for tables. I understand that restaurants fall behind;;;;;;;

Maiz 64;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/maiz-64-washington-2?not_recommended_start=0;Alex B.;4.0;7/26/2022;We went here for a dinner date night last week and were overall very impressed and satisfied with our experience! We have been wanting to check out Maiz 64 for quite some time now, and it did not disappoint. We sat inside and had a really great server who walked us through all of the seasonal options on the menu, along with recommendations for the cocktail program. The cocktails were all very good--my favorite being the Alma de Maiz, for which I opted for the tequila version. I also had the Barbacoa Old Fashioned cocktail, which was unfortunately somewhat underwhelming to me even though I love a good old fashioned.I genuinely enjoyed all of the food that we had. The brisket dish that I had was some of the best brisket that I think I've ever eaten, which is not what I expected to feel! The dish was expensive, but hey...kind of what you expect from the best brisket you think you've ever had right? We left the restaurant very full, although I wish I had some space in the tummy to check out a dessert dish. Overall - I'd absolutely recommend Maiz 64 for a nice meal or special occasion. Nice atmosphere indoors, great attentive servers/staff, great cocktails and food. The reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is that I did think the prices are somewhat expensive given what you get, and we also had a couple fruit flies hovering around our table indoors, which was a mild inconvenience.

Maketto;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/maketto-washington-2?not_recommended_start=0;Fred J.;1.0;07/11/2024;"So mate, I walk into Maketto last night, looks like a nice place, never been and fancy myself up to the counter and have a chat with the bloke and order me up some grub. The Chrystal Shrimp Dumplings looks right tasty for $9 and the Num Pang Tofu Sandwich for $14 sounds good too. I ask for take out, not a problem eh? I'm tired as piss of poor service like the rest of the bloody planet yet expected to tip out me arse and pretend to like it. Bollocks, I ain't tipping for take out where I stand to order food, stand to wait and they don't do a thing but shove it in a bag. Tipping is discretionary at take out, leave a tip jar or can mate. So to my surprise after the chap prints out the ticket for me to review I take notice a ""Take out Gratuity"" line for $5. I ask what this is all about and the gent doesn't answer the question with an explanation but defensively asks if there is a problem. Quite right there's a problem, what the bloody hell is a ""Take out Gratuity""? I politely but firmly explain by definition a ""gratuity"" or ""tip"" by definition is voluntary and if its automatic or mandatory then its a surcharge. I defended my position by stating I would permit my order to go through if the so called imposed ""Gratuity"" was removed. He declined and thus I had to stick to me guns and shove off. Let's do the math lad- $14+$9=$23 and now for the kicker because that pretty ""Take out gratuity"" is not a true voluntary tip it bloody counts like a food or drink item so it's taxed too. So, $23+$5=$28 then lets add the raging 10% sales/restaurant tax that's $2.80. Total is $30.80.  So, here's the tally, $7.80 of taxes and ""Take out Gratuity"" is 33.91% on a $23 take out meal. In no way should any body have to pay this much in taxes and surcharges on a meal in Washington DC or any place else. The only way mates is to say ""NO"" loud and clear and call these places out. I'm all for earning a decent wage, I'm all for tipping generously for sit down service but to be forced to pay for great service and receive mediocre service which lets be honest occurs a good bit o' the time is not acceptable. Maketto, what will you do? Be honest, change the language of your tickets call it what it really is a Take out Surcharge, if you want the $5 fine, continue to charge it, but don't blow smoke up our arses and call it a ""gratuity"". That's insulting, deceptive, and certainly excessive. 33.91% is too much to bear for working stiffs like me and I'm sure a lot of other hard working middle class folks. Maketto, what will you do?";Alexandria, VA;0;6;2544;489;0;0

First, the wait time for our dishes was atrocious. The dishes came at different times to the point where everyone had to eat their food separately. This would have been acceptable if our waiter bothered to tell us that the food is served as it made. After the long wait, we reached more disappointment with the fried rice noodles, which were subpar. To be fair, pork baos and dumplings were good. However, if you're into the whole ""sketchy Chinatown corner restaurant"" aesthetic, then this might just be for you.

Maketto;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/maketto-washington-2?not_recommended_start=20;Aubrey W.;5.0;12/19/2024;I recently visited Maketto for their weekend Dim Sum brunch experience. All I can say is come hungry, and be prepared to eat some delicious food! I highly recommend doing the Dim Sum brunch, it is an amazing bang for your buck ($38 per person) and we got to try so many different dishes! They also have standard a la carte brunch, but I recommend checking their Instagram to see when the bottomless Dim Sum brunch is being offered. Our favorite dishes included the Maketto Fried Chicken, the Rice Roll with Roast Pork, the Crispy Turnip Cake with XO, and the Ginger Chicken Soup Dumplings. The fried chicken is essential. The seasoning of the crust is unlike any fried chicken I've ever had, and it was so crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The rice roll was so fresh, and I loved the texture of the roast pork with crunchy edges. The brightness of the fresh herbs really completed this dish. The crispy turnip cake was a very unique and interesting texture, almost like mochi. It was addictively good. The broth the soup dumplings were sitting in was perfectly acidic and spicy. I loved the combination of this broth with the classic chicken soup broth inside the dumplings. We also got the pork steamed bao, which was good, but felt a little one note texturally. It was soft braised pork inside a soft bao bun: I would have loved a crunchy element. Lastly, we had the egg custard tart for dessert, which was heavenly. The pie crust exterior was a fun take on a classic dessert! My only complaint with this experience is although we had a reservation, we still had to wait about 20 minutes for our table. Highly recommend Maketto for a unique, delicious Asian fusion meal!;Washington, DC;27;168;1685;302;1;337

It's that good. The best part about the food here is the uniqueness and the pop of fusion flavors you get with each dish. Maketto's Asian fusion cuisine offers a delightful blend of traditional and contemporary tastes that leave a lasting impression.So far, I've sampled a variety of dishes, including the pork bao, fried chicken, crystal shrimp dumplings, wok fried noodles with pork, spicy cauliflower, wok fried yu choy, tofu with spicy basil sauce, and several of their unique drinks. Each visit, I'm impressed by the consistent quality and creativity of the food. This time, I indulged in the fried chicken, dumplings, and fried noodles again--they were exceptional, as always.I highly recommend visiting Maketto with a few friends and trying a variety of dishes, family-style. Sharing multiple dishes allows you to experience the full spectrum of flavors and textures the menu offers. The standout feature of Maketto is the overall menu combined with the trendy and modern interior design. The atmosphere is both inviting and chic, making it a great spot for a casual dinner or a special night out.The service at Maketto is top-notch. The hosts, waiters, busboys, and cooks are all super nice and friendly, contributing to a warm and welcoming dining experience. Their attentiveness and hospitality make every visit pleasant and enjoyable.While these aren't negatives, I do have a couple of tips for improving your visit:1. Parking: Plan for difficult parking as the restaurant is surrounded by neighborhoods and zones where parking is limited. Consider using a ride-sharing service or public transportation if possible.2. Reservations: Reserve your dining time ahead of time to avoid long waits. Maketto is popular, and securing a reservation can make your experience smoother and more enjoyable.If this place were slightly cheaper and closer, I would go every week, no exaggeration. The exceptional food, stylish ambiance, and friendly service make Maketto a standout in the Asian fusion scene. I give Maketto a solid 5/5. It's definitely a must-visit place if you're visiting or anywhere nearby although I also hope they don't blow up more than this so I can keep dining here.;Ellicott City, MD;339;24;2281;367;1;49

The food here is top notch and reasonably priced for the quality and portion size. I just want to say, the staff at Maketto have done a truly incredible job with outdoor dining. It's contactless and you order everything from food to to-go boxes by scanning a QR code to minimize contact between guests and staff. The tables are separated out but nobody else was there when I went so we were seated in their heated cabana at a table for 6 (max number for parties as it seems). There were two heat lamps so even on a cold, January night, we were all very warm and able to enjoy our meal outside. The food, as always, was excellent. Get the Cambodian noodle salad, lo mein, or Cambodian style pho as a main and the spring rolls or leek and mushroom baos as an appetizer. The medium sized plates are perfect for one person and you will likely have leftovers, too. The thing about their noodle salad is that the rice noodles don't disintegrate into mush when you take them home as leftovers, which is a HUGE bonus.;Washington, DC;3;85;1178;221;1;145

Ditto for the fried chicken, which was juicy on the inside, sweet and spicy on the outside. We also enjoyed lots of other items on the dim sum menu. We ordered one of each of the vegetarian and seafood options. We did not try the pork or beef options bc none of us eat that form of protein.I had a soy latte which was very smooth and no sugar needed which is in my opinion the sign of quality beans and brew.

I really liked the eclectic offerings at that time and was very interested in seeing what this new space would be like. It's a shared space (retail/light fare/ full service) similar to some spaces I've seen in the bay area and in Europe. Aesthetically it's impressive. I was given the full tour by Dom (the retail manager) and made to feel at home while i waited for both a table and my wife. Upstairs they feature coffee and eclectic magazine and retail choices as well as a dope vending machine that offers odd tchotchkes (it hides around the corner near the walkway to the open space past the coffee bar). The main entry area features a nice selection of attire and footwear and the retail ""assistants"" serve double duty as greeters and made the environment feel less stressed. We were seated at the bar near the chef and our waiter was very knowledgeable and offered great recommendations. Service was damn near instantaneous and we never wanted for anything. The food was stellar, the kitchen staff was fun and we had a great time. The bill was hefty, but well worth it.";Washington, DC;1;9;1152;207;1;0

Worth going back if looking for something in this area but wouldn't seek it out.---FOOD: ordered happy hour salmon avocado roll and the roll with truffle. Could barely taste the truffle though the portions / amount of fish was what I would expect. Can't really tell quality of fish from the rolls, but seemed fine. I would go back and try their sashimi which is my usual go to. Wasn't thrilled with the happy hour prices - not much of a discount though the menu has a lot of optionsDRINKS: didn't order anything but they had a lot of optionsSERVICE: fine - they were prompt and got us what we needed. Nothing particularly special. They didn't interact that much which is fine.ATMOSPHERE: the location is a bit odd to walk into - in a basement and such.

Oh, but you're not into pineapple? Ok, share the Stolen Mercedes with your friends (the drink, don't actually steal a Mercedes -- or do but don't mention my name). Not into sharing? Oh, ok, that's fine, why don't you have a sip of(f) the Retired Stripper? Not drinking tonight just hungry? Awesome, try the best deviled eggs and have your mind blown. Bottom line here is, whether you're looking to relax after work or party hard on the weekend, whether you just want a quick bite before heading home or whether you want to eat 'til you have to unbutton your pants and roll your way back into bed, Archipelago offers the most relaxing atmosphere with amazing music (playing anything from old ska and funk to surf music), delicate and thoughtful decoration that transports you to some alternate Tiki dimension (of course bartenders wearing Hawaiian themed shirts also helps), and various cocktails, drinks and food options. Would highly recommend coming here if you're looking for something different, fun, and an overall unique experience that will leave you (drunk) and wanting more. Ps: I don't know wtf the other reviews are talking about, but the drinks here are strong, so be certain that your money is going to good use.;Washington, DC;47;4;1640;291;1;8
Rasika;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rasika-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Emanuel R.;1.0;1/17/2025;Unacceptable and Unprofessional ExperienceI was extremely disappointed with my recent visit to Rasika. My group and I were unfairly accused of something we didn't do, and instead of handling the situation professionally, a staff member attempted to intimidate us. What made matters worse was that he physically touched one of the women in our group, which was completely inappropriate and unacceptable.To add to the frustration, the restaurant tried to charge us for two entrÃ©es we never ordered. This level of unprofessionalism is shocking for a place with such a reputation. Instead of resolving the issue with integrity, they escalated the situation and made our experience uncomfortable.I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone who values respect, professionalism, and proper customer service.

Rasika;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rasika-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Deep K.;1.0;10/12/2024;"I visited Rasika with my family, fully expecting to enjoy a delightful meal together. Unfortunately, our experience was far from enjoyable, and I felt compelled to share our experience.Upon arrival, we were in great spirits, eager to indulge in a hearty meal. We ordered Dal Makhani and Chicken Masala, but to our disappointment, the Dal Makhani was overly sugary sweet, and the Chicken Masala had a distinctly stale odor. Not wanting to spoil our family day, we set those aside and opted to order additional items.This is where our troubles truly began. Our server--man in his 50s with a ponytail(likely Javier as per the bill)--exuded an unsettling air of overconfidence from the start. When we asked if he had noted our order, he dismissively assured us that he ""remembered everything"" and that we shouldn't attempt to ""teach him his job."" we chose to overlook this rudeness to keep the atmosphere pleasant for our family.As we waited for our additional orders, time dragged on. After 34 minutes, I inquired about the status, and he curtly informed me that they were still preparing our food. An hour and 20 minutes later, I asked again and was met with an equally dismissive remark about the volume of customers they serve daily. Finally, after an excruciating 1 hour and 35 minutes, our second order arrived. During our wait, bussers approached our table multiple times, asking if we were finished so they could clean up, which only added to our frustration.I have never encountered such unprofessional and rude service in any restaurant. The overall quality of food was average, and the lack of hospitality was glaring. It is evident that, despite this restaurant might be serving volume of customers, Rasika has not grasped the fundamental principle of treating customers with respect and primarily the reason for the average food quality and delay in their orders. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. If you value your time and expect a hospitable dining experience, look elsewhere.";Washington, DC;0;2;2003;331;0;1

Rasika;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rasika-washington?not_recommended_start=20;Greg W.;2.0;8/25/2019;Meh.I think I ought to preface the whole thing by saying I have to judge the whole experience on value and on that I'm just simply far less than impressed. I'm trying to be understanding here, and a table of five 30 year old guys at 9:45 at night I'm sure the server looked at us and set his expectations low. Had to have, and I'm sure he worked hard on what was a long Saturday night and we were at the end of it but such rote, lackluster, unemotional service I have not seen in a long time. Sure there was nothing WRONG, forks were replaced, waters were refilled, but the bare minimum of motions were went through. 4/5ths of us ordered the coursed menu with wine pairings and we got a light dusting of regurgitated information delivered meekly to one side of the table with each course. But the meal is the more important part right?The appetizer fish was actually delightful. Cooked well, and flavorful. I can't say I understood the wine pairing but it was totally okay. The second course lamb was also very nice, though largely unmemorable. The wine pairing here was actually intriguing, a fresh white, earthy and bright that actually worked well with the dish despite going against conventional pairing ideology and at this point I was quite hopeful for the rest of the meal. But the main was about as drab as you could imagine. 4 portions of different dishes that just felt prepared in a large stock pot and ladled into an ornate serving dish with the seeming intent to beguile someone who prefers facade to substance. A 4 portion dish, with a fair range of flavors, matching with a wine, can certainly be tough, though if done well could certainly take you on a fun journey, but alas the wine smacked of an inexpensive, sulfite ridden red that they got a quantity discount on. The dishes were fine but just felt like little thought was put into them exemplified by one being essentially a vegetable compote bath hiding a large frankly unmanageable and (at this point) vastly overcooked shrimp. The dessert was more of the same, classic, routine, fried dough ball, rice pudding, ice cream with borderline freezer burned fruit rocks lodged in, and a drier than sand lentil cake, again seemingly prepared en masse then plopped on a compartmentalized cafeteria tray. The wine a sickly sweet blend of Sauv Blanc, and apparently the least interesting Chenin I've ever tasted and at this point locking in the theory that the wines were chosen based on a conceived notion of what people wanted to drink and in no way shape or form considered the food at all.It was just an overall uninspired experience. When you have a $150 a head bill and a 20% tip on top of that, sorry, your food and service get judged based on that and I can not in good conscious say either was worth a fraction of that cost. I got nothing that I felt I couldn't get somewhere else and in a world of options I'd just have to recommend literally any other option. Side note the server gave us another table's itemized copy of the bill but I was so done with shy Ben Stein it wasn't even worth tracking him down.;Dayton, MD;2;11;3082;558;1;1

Rasika;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rasika-washington?not_recommended_start=20;Raja B.;2.0;5/15/2017;"I don't usually do reviews but I believe people deserve to hear this. I took my wife there for her birthday with really high expectations but we left quite disappointed. I made reservations weeks in advance and got a call two days before asking if I'm ok with a prefixed menu for Mother's Day, if not, they can cancel my reservation. I said okay because I had already planned her birthday in DC around it and didn't think it would be terrible. Very few options in the prefixed menu. We got the palak chaat to start off with. The first couple of bites were good but it got way too heavy and my wife was pretty much full after.For the main course we got tikka masala and lamb achari. Mediocre. There are so many places in the DMV area that serve better tikka masala. Dessert was mango ras malai, rose ice cream, and gulab jaman creme brÃ»lÃ©e. It was good, we both enjoyed the creme brÃ»lÃ©e a lot. The other two were too sweet, but good flavors. Then the waiter came with two champagne glasses to toast my wife a happy birthday, which was really nice of them. However, we told him we don't drink alcohol and he said ""Oh ok, well happy birthday"" and took it back. Most restaurants would come back with another drink or do a small dessert, but nope. In fact, we would have been more than happy with just a candle in the dessert that came with our meal. So simple. Overall the experience was so not worth the hype. Hype being the keyword, as Rasika tries its best to create hype for their restaurant. It's called psychological manipulation of the mind where the consumer is led to believe this is some exceptional food they are about to experience due to the hype and the mind tricks itself into actually believing they're eating good food. It's also a way for us to rationalize over-priced food. It isn't until you leave the place (maybe even a few days after) that you realize that your mind was tricked. I'm sure they know they are not that unique tasting, and that most of the items can be found at other Indian/Pakistani restaurants which taste authentic and ten times better. I can now see what some of the other reviewers said about Rasika being pretentious and not worth the hype. Save your time and money and please go somewhere else. Two stars instead of one because one-third of the dessert was tasty and the service was overall efficient.";Fairfax, VA;2;3;2342;429;1;4

Rasika;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rasika-washington?not_recommended_start=20;Fatima Q.;2.0;01/06/2015;"After extensive research on multiple websites, I found Rasika to have great ratings for a fine dining Indian experience in the heart of D.C. We were looking forward to a sit-down dinner, but after purchasing last minute tickets to a Broadway show, we realized we might be too late for a full course meal. At 10:45 pm, when our show ended, we called in a phone order for 2 of their Lamb Kathi Rolls, as they closed at 11. Ten minutes later, we arrived to the restaurant and were greeted by the host, who said its not too late for the two of us to have a full service meal if we would like a table. I informed him that I had placed an order for 2 rolls to-go, but would highly appreciate it if we could sit down, and have a full meal, along with our rolls. Unfortunately he said they cannot ""unbox"" the rolls and serve them to us. I felt this was very unhelpful. Next, I asked for to/go cokes since we were being forced to continue our to-go meal but apparently they didn't have disposable cups. Lastly, as we were leaving, my husband ordered a Sev Puri Chaat, which is just a combination of ingredients thrown into a bowl and mixed together. We kindly requested to leave out the raw mangoes, which the host refused to do, because he said its pre-mixed. That is pretty hard to believe, considering that we are authentic Indians and know that all the ingredients of a ""Chaat"" are added upon receiving the order, due to sogginess of the ""puris.""When a restaurant rates as one of the top ten in its city, I would hope the customer service is better than that.

The ambience was just okay and while the food was excellent, the portions were stingy and there wasn't a vast selection. I did return several times after for carryout to get the scallop dish--sorry, don't remember the name--but never have come back for a sitdown meal.

We ordered palak chaat and were pleasantly surprised. We also ordered the Black Cod. The fish was very fresh and was fantastic. This would've been the most incredible dish if it weren't so spicy. I loved the Palak Chaat as this was my first time trying out this dish. As some others have mentioned it was GREAT, but we thought it was a little too oily. Why did they put so much oil??? Nevertheless it was worth a try and it did taste great.In general, the food and atmosphere was very good, I will definitely be coming back. The portions were a little small for my liking and the prices were a little steep, but overall, we came away happy. The total I paid at the end was what I was expected and it was similar to what other small plates places would have cost me.I felt like the staff there were very courteous and knowledgeable about their food, which added to the positive feeling I received while at the restaurant. I was happy that they brought water, without having to ask for it. Not being used to spicy food, water was definitely necessary!We were glad that we came in the off peak hours before it becomes one of the places where you have to wait for hours to get tables.

The little business I was managing to help my family with was going down, so I called my sister who lives in North Carolina, she introduced me to this Credit Specialist. He did a wonderful job on my credit report. I was amazed when I saw how everything reflected on my profile perfectly. He wiped out the bad items off my report and also loaded my account with $18,000. I got a high score of 786 with a good credit limit. This is all I can say about him compared to other good reviews I read about him on the internet.

Rasika;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rasika-washington?not_recommended_start=120;Jeff L.;5.0;03/12/2021;For appetizers, the ordered the Palak Chaat and Mango Shrimp. This is my second time having the Palak Chaat and it was even better than the first time. The spinach is just so crisp and mixed with the tomatoes, toppings, and sauces creates the perfect balance of textures and flavors. The Mango Shrimp was also delicious. It was cooked perfectly and the green sauce really complimented it, however I didn't get too much of a mango flavor.For entrees, we got the Mixed Grill and the Chicken Makhani along with garlic & herb and truffle naan. Highly recommend the Mixed Grill if you want a little taste of all the proteins. Although it doesn't look like much (one piece of salmon, 2 prices of chicken, 1 lamb kabob, and basmati rice), it is actually very filling. Although all the meats were seasoned very well and cooked perfectly, the lamb kabob was my favorite. The Chicken Makhani was also so delicious. I usually don't go for butter chicken (my friend wanted to order it as our second dish) because I don't love super buttery dishes, but it was delicious. The curry is the perfect consistency to absorb into the basmati rice for a perfect curry bite. The chicken was so so tender and flavorful - I think I enjoyed this chicken more than the tandoori chicken in the Mixed Grill.;Andover, MA;0;3;1279;228;0;0

It is outstanding food at fairly high prices. Rasika is Indian food like you have probably not had it... Complex flavors and served in almost tapas sized portions.

Rasika;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rasika-washington?not_recommended_start=150;Richard W.;5.0;4/19/2017;Rasika serves Indian food with a twist that transforms it into something very exotic (I am of Indian origin and cook and eat Indian food all the time). Small plates of takes on Indian themes, and something different each time one goes there. The cocktails are very different and have Indian names that are more exotic than your standard Manhattan or Cosmo or Gin and Tonic.Rasika has valet parking. Getting a reservation is not easy and you may have to book well in advance to get a table - especially for a Friday evening!

Rasika;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rasika-washington?not_recommended_start=180;Jason K.;5.0;03/09/2015;So I've now been to Rasika twice now. The first time I was blown away by the appetizers and found our entrees to be pretty ordinary. This time? The two appetizers we got (palak chaat of course along with an egg plant dish) were once again excellent. As for the entrees? We went with tandoori salmon and rajsthani lamb curry. Thankfully they too were excellent. The salmon was perfectly done and the sauce went very well with the fish. My only gripe with Rasika this time was the cocktail options. Too many of them were gin based. It is the one alcohol I really don't like, so it was a little frustrating to have only 2 other options. Of course the restaurant has an extensive wine list and respectable beers, so I realize I am being rather petty and anal. Overall a fantastic restaurant. I am sure I will be back again some day.;Oakland, CA;125;1166;828;154;1;76

Rasika;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/rasika-washington?not_recommended_start=220;Pragna H.;5.0;10/14/2012;So I wanted to see how this five star restaurant staked up against the actual Indian restaurants that I was eating at during my recent trip to New Delhi. For me it blew away every Indian restaurant that I actually ate at in India. I don't actually know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Well for me it's a great thing because I didn't much like the food I had in New Delhi where as I absolutely loved everything I ate here and the service was definitely second to none. The food was actually much lighter than the same dishes I had in India which I was also thankful for. I remember every time I ate in New Delhi I would feel lousy for hours after because the meals were just so heavy and buttery. I did not have the same experience here.

Rasika is none of these.It is an amazing venue with crafted cocktails, inventive menu items, and a bustling inside. We have had the palak chaat (i know, everyone has), sea bass in a banana leaf, lamb dishes and chicken dishes (masalas, grilled). The black cod really is as good as mentioned and so flavorful. (anise, butter, rich)The sides are almost better than the main courses- cauliflower is great (sweet peas with a light curry). The scallops are wonderful and are perfectly cooked in a light creamy, spicy sauce. If you cant sit in the dining room wait and eat the bar or at least grab a lounge seat.

The Goat cheese Naan is to die for, and all of the chutneys were fantastic. Service was very attentive and concerned if we did eat everything (they genuinely thought we didn't enjoy it). But we did. I had the chicken Makhani as my entree and it was widely regarded as the best meal at the table. By the end of our lunch I was passing my bowl around for everyone to dip in. It was that good. The ice tea is a special ""Star of Africa"" tea that they bring in from Teaism. Most at our table loved it, but one sent it back and asked for a coke. An acquired taste perhaps? The only negative was the Chai afterwards. It was very mild and seemingly made with skim milk (a big mistake in my books). Otherwise it was a fantastic lunch and certainly one of my top 5 places to eat in DC.";Mill Valley, CA;15;90;844;163;1;0

The ambiance at Destino was really great - the market itself is a vibrant and exciting place, with frequent events and a wide variety of Latin American food stalls. While there is seating inside the restaurant, I would recommend enjoying Destino on a fall or summer day from the patio, where there are plenty of tables and umbrellas.The food at Destino was truly outstanding. The ceviche was a beautiful beet-red color and was absolutely delicious. The duck breast, braised in a prickly-pear gastrique, was also a standout. In addition, the desserts at Destino are not to be missed. The churro with fluffy sweet coconut and passionfruit cream was heavenly, and the ancho con chocolate chile - a chocolate dessert with the texture of a lava cake and the punch of smoky ancho chile - was truly unique and delicious.Overall, I had one of the best dinners I have had in this city at Destino.

Espita;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/espita-washington-2?not_recommended_start=0;Fabricio M.;1.0;3/18/2023;I recently dined at Restaurant Espita and while the food was good, the poor customer service left me disappointed. I have a medical condition that prevents me from drinking cold drinks, so when my friends and I all ordered Orchatas, I requested mine without ice. However, while everyone else was served a large glass of the drink, I was given a small cup that was only half-filled.I felt like it was a joke to try and avoid wasting space that ice cubes take up in a regular glass. It was only enough for two sips, which left me feeling disappointed and frustrated. As someone with a medical condition, I expect restaurants to be accommodating and take my needs into consideration.Unfortunately, the poor customer service in not properly accommodating my request left a negative impression on me, and I have no plans to return as a customer. While the food was good, the lack of consideration for my needs overshadowed the positive dining experience.In conclusion, while I enjoyed the food at Restaurant Espita, the poor customer service and lack of proper accommodation of my needs left a negative impression, and I would not recommend the restaurant to others.;Washington, DC;4;15;1161;197;1;4

Espita;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/espita-washington-2?not_recommended_start=0;K B.;1.0;8/13/2017;Bizarrely terrible service. First, our food came a good 10 minutes before our drinks. Ok - maybe the bar is running a little slow. But then the waitress brought the check without prompting while our plates were still full and our (very late) drinks were barely touched, and then kept agitatedly circling to see if we had left a card yet. It was like they absolutely couldn't wait for us to leave - which was strange, because the place was almost entirely empty.

Espita;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/espita-washington-2?not_recommended_start=0;Eric S.;1.0;5/15/2016;It's a shame that I have to spend time writing this review after too much time was already wasted at this restaurant. First impressions were quickly overwritten by our table not being ready until 15 minutes after our Sunday 12:00pm reservation, and drinks not being served ten minutes after being ordered. When we finally were able to place our food order from their limited brunch menu, instead of poached eggs I requested that my eggs be cooked scrambled. To you and me, this is an easier, quicker, and more fault-proof way of preparing eggs. When our food was brought out, my eggs were poached. I don't eat soft or runny eggs. Personal preference which I'm entitled to have as a patron. When I asked that my plate be taken back and the dish prepared with scrambled eggs, our waiter proceeded to tell me that they don't have scrambled eggs. This led me to believe that there was a language barrier between the waiter and I. I don't blame the waiter for not understanding my request, as I've spent plenty of time abroad and have experienced language barriers. However, to tell me that they don't have scrambled eggs, when eggs were sitting in front of me, I was a little confused. If the waiter didn't understand my request when putting in my order, he should have asked me, or another member of his team what I had meant instead of ignoring my request and letting the dish be prepared and served. He then left and gave me a thumbs up from across the restaurant, to me, indicating he understood my request and a new plate would be prepared. 15 minutes go by and I'm presented a plate of scrambled eggs next to my original dish. I asked to speak to the manager. The manager came and I told them I simply wanted my dish prepared with scrambled eggs. He told me he would like to have the dish prepared the way I like it, which I obliged to. 20 minutes go by, no dish. I got the attention of the manager and requested the check. I left without eating. I didn't want a comped meal, or comped items that my table had ordered. I wanted my dish prepared the way I requested, and when it wasn't prepared correctly, replaced timely. I don't have problems at restaurants. I don't send food back under many circumstance and I am happy to present references that will testify to this. But scrambled eggs, come on.;Fairfax, VA;0;4;2301;420;0;0

We started the meal off with guacamole and salsa verde cruda. We honestly could have stopped right there because the chips were so incredible, but wanted to save room for dinner. Our waiter was so knowledgeable about the menu,which was a big win for me because it was very unique and a lot of things were unfamiliar. He was right on point with the amount of food for us to share family style and we couldn't have been happier with his suggestions. The food was not only incredible but the presentation was beautiful.

What makes this place special is the details in the cooking and the time put into their menu. Stopped in for dinner early in the week and was blown away by how good the corn flavor of their tortilla is. I tried three different types of tortillas and they were all rich, delciious, soft and not crumbly. You can tell they were made that morning. All of the sauces were complex and vibrant with flavors that changed throughout the experience. Recommended are the Al Pastor tacos, Lamb Mole, and Tamal. Our drinks were well paired with the food and the cocktail menu was really interesting. Lots of ingredients and combinations I've never seen before led me to try the Snap Pea Highball which was vibrant, fresh, tart with a little smoke. I could taste fresh from the garden snap peas, and fernet foam on top!? What!Oaxacan cuisine is truly celebrated here without feeling contrived or kitschy. It's like being in modern Mexico, not my grandmother's Mexico.The difference in the details here is clear and hands down my new favorite restaurant in the city.

Compass Rose;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/compass-rose-washington-3?not_recommended_start=0;Sam H.;1.0;02/09/2025;"I visited Compass Rose several years ago and, unfortunately, had a less-than-ideal experience. We were seated in the lower level, uncomfortably cramped shoulder to shoulder with other diners, making it nearly impossible to hold a conversation. The food was simply average, and the atmosphere was subpar at best.So, when I was scouting restaurant options for a group of 10-15 people, I was understandably hesitant to give this venue another try. However, in the spirit of due diligence, I decided to revisit the restaurant.What initially piqued my interest was the recent buzz around Compass Rose's ""Tour of the World"" tasting menu, which had been featured in videos by several D.C.-based food influencers. From what I gathered--likely in coordination with the restaurant's marketing team--this menu was advertised as a pre-fixed selection allowing diners to sample various items at a set price ($42 for brunch, $57 for dinner). This seemed like the perfect way to evaluate their offerings.To ensure this wasn't just a social media promotion that had since been discontinued, I went directly to Compass Rose's website and reviewed both their brunch and dinner menus. Nowhere was it indicated that this tasting menu was restricted to groups.After planning this visit for two days and canceling reservations elsewhere, I arrived at Compass Rose only to be informed that the ""Tour of the World"" menu was available exclusively for groups--a crucial detail that was missing from their website, social media, menu, or any influencer-led promotions.Having already had a disappointing experience here once before, I was frustrated to learn that my only option to sample the menu as an individual diner was to either spend significantly more money or return with additional people. I attempted to work out a way to try a variety of dishes in a reasonable manner, but the pricing structure made it infeasible.When I asked if the restaurant could accommodate me in any way, I was told no--twice--by the staff. At this point, I was understandably frustrated.Eventually, I spoke with the restaurant's Director of Operations, explaining how the misleading advertising, incomplete menu descriptions highlighting a required group, and overall unwillingness to adjust for a customer who had specifically set aside time to try this menu was unacceptable. To her credit, she apologized and assured me that the restaurant would update its menus and improve its advertising to clarify the tasting menu's restrictions re party size. However, based on my interactions with staff--one of whom mentioned that several other solo diners had encountered the same issue--it was clear that this had been a known problem for some time, yet no changes had been made.More importantly, while I appreciated the acknowledgment of the issue, I was still left with no resolution for the time and effort I had wasted due to Compass Rose's misleading promotions.Considering my past negative experience, what appears to be an ongoing pattern of disregarded customer dissatisfaction, and the fact that I lost an entire morning due to deceptive or poorly managed advertising, I would caution potential diners against visiting Compass Rose. In a vibrant dining scene like 14th & U, there are plenty of restaurants where you'll receive exactly what's advertised and enjoy a far better experience.Additionally, please see attached pictures of the restaurants menus as well as screenshots of their social media advertising which sells this as an almost restaurant week-esque tasting menu open to all.";Washington, DC;0;5;3552;558;0;4

That was the worst decision ever! We were totally disappointed! We were excited to order Armenian ground beef kebab( Lulya) In addition to some appetizers and Georgian khachapuri ( I grew up in Georgia). To our surprise it was a salty sausage rather than a ground beef kebab and it tasted awful!!! It is disgrace to use Armenian name on a dish like that. Georgian khachapuri was half baked with only one egg on it. The service was nowhere to be found! After reporting to the server and the host no apology was given from the restaurant! We were embarrassed and disgusted! We would never go back there again!!!;Potomac Falls, VA;22;13;738;132;1;13

Compass Rose;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/compass-rose-washington-3?not_recommended_start=0;Karen D.;1.0;05/01/2014;We wanted to like this place so much since it's literally right around the corner from our house. So, after the much anticipated wait me hubby and several neighbors went this past Thursday to go try it out. First impression when you walk in is pretty good.The front of the restaurant/bar, I guess it's the lounge, looks fantastic but we were led to the back dining room which was quite dreary cold and dark. I like ambience but it was too dark to read the menus and when I asked our server to relight our dead candle we got a little bit of attitude from him? We also asked if he could get the temperature adjusted and it seemed like it got colder. Food was ok not bad but just underwhelming if not a bit overpriced for what you pay. What really soured the experience for us was the very poor service. The whole food menu, wine, beer, and cocktail list all fit on one page but our server didn't seem to have much knowledge about any of it. The place is new, but like I said all the menus fit on one page. You can probably learn the whole thing in a couple of hours. We were charged for 2 glasses of wine that we never ordered or received. We did ask to speak to a manager, the reply?;;;;;;;

The pastries were out in the open, uncovered, and mislabeled. Other items were in a small case below. The ham and cheese ""quiche"" that I ordered was mislabeled as something $2 cheaper. The quiche itself was pretty terrible. It was a tiny square about 3x3 inches and maybe a half inch high for just under $6. The quiche was dense and mostly tasted like cheese and was dried out as though it had been sitting in the case since the prior morning. The pastry was also lackluster and I picked most of it off. It also looked very dried out like it has been sitting out in the case for at least a day.

The cocktails are skillfully crafted, adding to the overall experience. However, I find the food, particularly the wings, less impressive. At $14 for just five small wings, they are overpriced and only mediocre in flavor.

The Haymaker Bar;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-haymaker-bar-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Emily H.;4.0;8/21/2016;"The lowdown: This used to be Atlas Room--an upscale American restaurant that I LOVED. So anything that took it's place would face high scrutiny. That said, it's more of a bar than a restaraunt so there's not really a comparison. The inside was redesigned and is more spacious and bright. It's still not a space for big parties but if you head over with three friends or less, you shouldn't have a problem finding a spot. Seating is first come first served. They have food but it's mainly snacks--wings, sandwiches and tots. I will say, though, the tots are so good. They are mixed with cheese, chives, bacon, etc. Based on this selection, I'm assuming even though the menu is limited, the food is good. The sandwiches looked really good. My one suggestion would be to have desserts. I believe in my heart that Haymaker wants to be a restaurant. You don't make gourmet Korean chicken wings to just be a bar. And no matter how small or simple the restaurant, you MUST have sweets. Bread pudding, chocolate cake, panna cotta, gelato--give me something. Baileys and cookies?? Yes, this is all about what I want. Now for what you care about: the happy hour is amazing. $5 rail drinks but the ""rail"" includes Tanqueray and the like. No bottom shelf gross liquor that will make you regret happy hour the next morning. Haymaker is off to a good start. I plan to become a regular and continue demanding some sugar on top of the savory.";Washington, DC;53;130;1426;255;1;1

As a Marine combat veteran from the war in Afghanistan (Marjah Afghanistan 2010) I am fascinated by the US government, flaws and all. I am new to the area and live in Northern VA so I decided to get a hotel in DC to experience election night there for the first time. To my dismay the city was completely dead when I finally made it out. I assumed I would be able to find food but nearly everything was closed! After not eating anything all day, panic began to set in. While in an Uber I saw Z Burger and an adjacent bar. I stopped my ride on the spot and headed inside. Upon entering the restaurant, Peter was the first person I encountered. He informed me they had actually been closed for nearly an hour at that point. Seeing the excitement in my eyes turn to utter disappointment, he offered to make me fries on the house. He then proceeded to make me a chicken sandwich with the fries. Anyone who has eaten at this restaurant knows the food is fantastic. That being said, the review I wish to give is a review of the person I met that night, Peter Tabibian. Peter is a kind, generous, and talented man who saw a person in need and chose to make a difference in at least one persons life that night, mine. To me, the best gift one can give is to restore someones faith in humanity. Peter, you gave me that gift and I am deeply thankful.  Please support this man and his employees.

A rare thing for Persian restaurants is providing the best of the cuisine which is much more labor intensive to make, that is not kabob, but the stews... for example Gormeh Sabzi and Fesenjoon, which to me are God's gift to humanity [note I'm half-Persian but full-crazy for Persian food]. They even went next-level and provided a VEGAN option for the Gormeh Sabzi with tofu. This is a bold move. I'm gonna be honest the tofu is not the same as the meat, but they really did the best that can be done (I did add a dash of salt and it was awesome). Though I'm a wanna be vegetarian, the kabobs are super delicious - moist, flavorful, and portions are generously sized making for fantastic leftovers. The rice is super long and high quality (many Persians care about this weird nuance). But let's go back to the veggo options - the falafel, though not Persian per se - is knock your socks off esp with the tahini sauce. [TMI but I'm salivating heavily writing this]  They are freshly open so be kind, kinks being worked out. The staff members are welcoming and warm.

The service was very slow, drinks took a long time. Though the drinks (Brunch Cocktails, we tried all of them) were pretty good. The food was unremarkable, mediocre overall. Food came out at different times, often far apart. I know this is partly intentional, but the way it did was more because everything was slow and not coordinated. Picante Huevos was pretty good, as were the Dorayaki. But the Tortilla China was like La Choy Egg Foo Yung, except not as good and the Jook was blah. It seems like they still haven't figured out how to coordinate everything to make it work in terms of service and quality of food. The atmosphere I'd sum up as: trying too hard. It's ok, but not great, seems like it's trying too hard to be hip, a bit inauthentic. I wouldn't recommend against trying it, but I wouldn't recommend it either. There are a lot of other, better options, unless they work to improve both the food and the service, as well as the atmosphere. Disappointing.;Washington, DC;0;5;1031;184;0;1

So congratulations.As for the dishes we loved them all. From the plantain chips and sauce to the lomo saltado - all left us wanting more.

Via Sophia;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/via-sophia-washington-3?not_recommended_start=0;Jessie M.;1.0;04/10/2023;"Our family went to Easter Brunch here on Sunday. They refused to accommodate any dietary restrictions or allergies (my sister is vegetarian, I have food allergies, and my 2-year-old daughter can only eat soft food due to a serious mouth injury the night before). We asked if we could just get bread or lettuce or yogurt- anything simple so we wouldn't be hungry. They were incredibly rude in saying no. It took an hour to place an order for the people who could eat food off their menu. My poor daughter, after being in the emergency room most of the night, cried and said ""I'm hungry"" the entire meal as they wouldn't provide anything soft for her. The food, for those who got any, took another hour. We were ultimately charged for 4 adults (only 2 ate) and 2 children (none of whom ate-- my nephew is 7 months old and is not on solid food). It cost $310 and we each took a separate trip to McDonalds on the way home because we were starving. Had we been provided a menu ahead of time or a note that said they wouldn't accommodate vegetarians or allergies, we would not have made the reservation. Typically, most restaurants have a vegetarian option and will provide *something* for those with allergies.";Los Altos Hills, CA;71;40;1205;218;0;3

At this point, the restaurant was half occupied. Our water glasses remained unfilled, and the service could only be described as exceedingly slow, with every table visibly teetering on the edge of frustration. As the room filled, observations of surrounding guests revealed dissatisfaction centered around delays in service, food, beverages, and the delivery of checks. At one point, a server was overheard expressing remorse to a colleague, saying, ""I feel bad."" There's underlying issues with training or operational awareness.

The service was polite and efficient (average).Based on vibrant photos I had seen online, I expected a livelier, brighter space, but instead, the decor felt somewhat subdued. It wasn't bad, but it didn't match the energy I had anticipated.The food, however, was the highlight. We tried the Spicy Salmon and Eel rolls along with the signature Pearl and Alexandrite rolls. The Alexandrite roll was by far the standout--fresh, flavorful, and complex. The Spicy Salmon and Eel rolls were good, though they didn't match the brilliance of the Alexandrite.To complement our meal, we enjoyed the Kuromatsu Hakushika Snow Beauty cold sake, which was crisp and smooth--definitely something I'd order again. While the food was excellent, I'd love to see a more vibrant atmosphere to take the experience to the next level.

District Taco;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/district-taco-washington-6?not_recommended_start=60;Jean T.;4.0;11/15/2016;the good: This is one of the outlets of a DC only chain of Mexican restaurants. Started out as a food truck. Usually it is not cheap to eat out in the District but this is an exception. The tacos have six possible fillings with an assortment of toppings and salsas. The veggies were all fresh, the meat fillings all delicious. The Burrito Mojado plate was large, more than enough food for most people. Both dishes are only $8.  the bad: Its very crowded inside, mainly because there aren't that many seats. Lines to order were a little long, but nothing terrible, and moved quickly. People taking orders weren't particularly friendly.;Washington, DC;58;8;635;111;1;4

District Taco;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/district-taco-washington-6?not_recommended_start=70;Melvin B.;4.0;06/03/2015;I thought Chipotle was the best thing ever once they started serving breakfast burritos with chorizo as a meat choice. Now I can get chorizo at all hours of the day thanks to District Taco. Because I love chorizo so much, I was a little bit confused about why it was only listed as a topping, as opposed to a meat choice, but I like chicken, I like chorizo, and I like it when I can combine the two items to make one amazing taco (or three).They messed up my order once. I asked for a side of rice, and they put it inside my tacos. Not that I really cared, but I got to enjoy twice as much rice after they brought me a brand new side of rice. Yum. The cards they give you to identify your order are pretty cool. I really love it when I receive the purple elephant.;Washington, DC;0;3;764;153;1;0

Also they have fish tacos, Chipotle definitely does not serve fish and certain flavors that you can add like the green salsa. My advice would be to come here and let your wallet thank you. P.S one downside is that sometimes they may skimp on their single servings so definitely order double meat when you come to fill you up.;Washington, DC;0;7;453;82;1;0

Of course, I can't really tell the difference between a veggie burrito here, at Baja Fresh, Qdoba, or Chipotle. On the other hand, they're all good! However, District Taco has a salsa bar (not quite as good as BF) so you can spice up whatever you order quite a bit.Note: I'd probably give them 5 stars, except that I've come by 2 other times, only to be driven away by the crowds.

DauphineÂ’s;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/dauphine-s-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Harry T.;1.0;6/28/2021;"Absurdly poor service--unprecedented in DC for the caliber of restaurant they are trying to be. Waited 15 minutes post-reservation time for our table (which was one of the shorter wait times amongst various parties standing around also waiting for their tables. Couldn't order drinks at the bar during the wait for ""covid reasons""... Eventually someone on the staff brought wine to some of the parties waiting but not us. We started a timer for a party who arrived after us and they hit 25 mins before a glass was given to them.After 10 minutes sitting at our table, we had to ask for our waiter (or any waiter) to take our drink order. Extensive wait times in between ordering, service, etc. No exaggeration, we waited over 30 minutes for the dessert course...again, the dessert course.From arrival to departure, we were at Dauphine's over two hours and certainly not by our choice. Not once did a manager or other member of the staff speak with our party regarding the extensive waits or poor service. One of the managers kept pacing the restaurant and stood in the corners looking completely overwhelmed.It's a new restaurant so maybe they are trying to find their footing.

DauphineÂ’s;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/dauphine-s-washington?not_recommended_start=0;Katherine R.;4.0;02/07/2024;I decided to try Dauphins during restaurant week, and the ambiance struck me right away. The restaurant is undeniably beautiful, but I couldn't help but notice it was quite loud. It made it a bit challenging to have a conversation with my friend, though I'm unsure if this is just the new normal or a sign of me getting older - we definitely struggled to hear each other- but were there for the food! I'd probably think twice about choosing it for a date night due to the noise level or a night out to catch up via convo. Now, onto the food - it was outstanding! I kicked off with the Cured Beef Carpaccio, followed by the Blackened Fish Creole, and wrapped up with the parsnip cake. All three dishes were a delightful journey of flavors, and at $55 for the entire experience, I found it to be reasonably priced. Despite the noise, the culinary experience left a lasting impression.;Washington, DC;117;156;882;161;1;52

DauphineÂ’s;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/dauphine-s-washington?not_recommended_start=10;Elizabeth V.;5.0;10/06/2023;I recently had the pleasure of dining at Dauphine's in Washington DC during restaurant week, and I can confidently say that it was an exquisite culinary experience that left a lasting impression. As a Bib Gourmand restaurant, Dauphine's had set high expectations, and it surpassed them in every way.The ambiance of Dauphine's exudes elegance with a touch of Southern charm. The interior design is tasteful and inviting, creating the perfect atmosphere for an upscale dining experience. The attentive and knowledgeable staff only added to the overall sense of hospitality.Now, onto the star of the show: the food. I started my meal with the corn bisque, and it was nothing short of a masterpiece. The creamy bisque had a depth of flavor that captured the essence of fresh, sweet corn. It was impeccably seasoned and garnished with a delicate drizzle of truffle oil, elevating it to another level of indulgence. The corn bisque was a delightful introduction to the culinary journey that awaited.For my main course, I selected the catfish creole, and it was a revelation. The catfish was perfectly cooked, flaky on the inside and wonderfully crispy on the outside. The creole sauce was a symphony of flavors, blending spicy and savory elements that danced on my taste buds. It was evident that each component of the dish was crafted with precision and care.Throughout the meal, I appreciated the attention to detail in both the presentation and the flavors. The portion sizes were generous without being overwhelming, allowing me to savor each bite. The menu at Dauphine's showcases a rich tapestry of Southern-inspired cuisine, and I could see the dedication to authenticity and quality in every dish.The wine selection was extensive and well-curated, offering the perfect accompaniments to the diverse menu options. The sommelier's recommendations were spot-on, enhancing my overall dining experience.Dauphine's has truly mastered the art of combining culinary excellence with Southern hospitality. It's no wonder it holds the prestigious Bib Gourmand designation. From the moment I stepped through the door to the final bite of dessert, my visit to Dauphine's was a gastronomic journey I won't soon forget.If you're seeking a restaurant that seamlessly blends tradition with innovation and offers a memorable dining experience during restaurant week or any time, I wholeheartedly recommend Dauphine's in Washington DC. It's a testament to the rich culinary tapestry of the South, expertly presented in the heart of the nation's capital.;Washington, DC;339;18;2536;399;1;26

My boyfriend is American White non-vegetarian and I'm an Indian vegetarian. He likes mild and I like it spicy and our tastes are really hard to capture. I have grown up with Indian home cooked food with a very adventurous mom so my palette is especially hard to please. I have had terrible food at many places in DC Indian restaurants. When I stepped in I was prepared to be disappointed again. Instead, I found the food to be absolutely bomb. In traditional words ""majho ai gayo."" We ordered a thali, vada pav, and kulfi. The owner came out when we were eating to check on us. Seeing my excitement he also offered us tea on the house. I was almost crying at how good the food was, which I tend to do when I finally have food that I love. I will go here again after my exams. The bill was a bit expensive for a college student like myself but I did not regret it one bit as I had not enjoyed such good food in DC area. if you are a vegetarian, do try Vada Pav and the Mung dal sabji. If you are a non-vegetarian non-spicy lover, try butter chicken and kulfi.

This establishment did not disappoint! It is a little expensive, but not much by a DC standard, expect to spend $20-25 a head, and plan on a comfortable tip because you'll want to leave one. The staff here is excellent and helpful, especially the owner/head chef who took it upon himself to come and check on us a couple times during our meal.

The service was spot on as they were quick to greet and were kind-hearted. The prices were fair for what I was paying for and I am glad that I got to experience such a pleasant dining experience.

The menu prices were misleading - some menus had different prices than others, and it seemed that the prices fluctuated often so there were some outdated prices, so there were charges that we weren't aware of at the end of the meal. In addition, there was a $7 per bottle charge for waters, even though we hadn't specified we wanted anything other than the normal kind. (Be sure to specify tap water, anything other insures a fee). It might've been our own naivetÃ©, but from our experience in other restaurants, we didn't think anything of bottled water coming to the table because they are usually complimentary. Food-wise, the safron taglierini came with noodles that were clumped, and the scallops were not fresh. It was incredibly flat. Overall, it was a poor experience and I would not come back.;Plano, TX;0;1;933;158;0;0

Tortino Restaurant;https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/tortino-restaurant-washington?not_recommended_start=10;Abigail M.;4.0;5/14/2018;Tortino is a good choice should you want tasty and reasonably priced Italian, and it is convenient and easy to reach. There are tables that have candles and white table clothes, but this is not a super high end place. Decibel level is bearable, particularly if you are at one of the little tables for two against the walls. Service was friendly and efficient.Now on to the food. My dinner companion and i both had the fish special with asparagus and mashed potatoes, and were not disappointed. THe portion size was just right. Shared a very well priced bottle of Chianti as well as a nice slice of cheesecake for dessert - also very nice. The menu has enough for everyone's tastes. Clientele was very diverse.

The Caprese type appetizer made with Burrata cheese was superb. The eggplant appetizer was also great. Thin slices of eggplant with a tomato sauce. The pan seared scallops were perfectly cooked over a cauliflower puree. Finally, the grilled marinated Portobello mushrooms were al dente with a balsamic drip. The spinach Tagliatelle with chicken was just right. Finally, the Roasted Veal Tenderloin was served medium rare as requested served over au gratin potatoes with a Black Truffle reduction. The couple next to us raved about the grilled pork chops. So don't go anywhere else before Tortino. By the way, very reasonably priced.;Northwest Washington, Washington, DC;1;9;661;104;1;0

Tortino's did not disappoint. We were a party of 5. My brother and I ordered the Fettuccine alla bolognese which we enjoyed tremendously. My wife ordered Veal Scallopini Piccata which I thought was the best dish at the table and one of the best I have tried in recent memory. Sister in law ordered Pan seared Scallops which I found to be good but not great and my daughter ordered the Butternut Squash Ravioli which everyone enjoyed as well. As you can tell we were a group that liked sharing our entrees with one another. Service was very good. At the end of the meal we rewarded ourselves with coffee and dessert to cap of a great day of sight-seeing and a delightful meal.

Great food at a very reasonable price. The ambiance was warm, but the music was on the loud side and didn't really go with that warm ambiance. It was a bit jarring. As for the food, we started with the calamari. It was just fried rings served with a ""spicy"" tomato sauce. It had a little more ""spice"" to it than a normal tomato sauce, but it certainly wasn't what most people would consider spicy. Nevertheless, it was pretty good. The rings were not overly greasy either, they were fried just right. My entree was the Agnolotti di Agnello. It was a little on the rich side, but it was quite flavorful and definitely filling. My mom had the grilled salmon, which was cooked perfectly: thoroughly cooked, but still moist. We ended our dinner with the tiramisu, which was excellent. Overall Tortino is a good Italian option. Prices are reasonable and the food is above average.";Oakland, CA;125;1166;927;166;1;76

Currently offering only takeout, we opted for the al pastor tacos. The meat boasts impressive flavor but tends to be on the dry side, craving a sauce to balance it out--relying solely on lime wasn't quite sufficient. Even the onions, while flavorful, struggled to counteract the charred edges of the meat. However, the taco shells were a highlight--soft, non-greasy, and resilient till the last bite. Though not the most budget-friendly option, they're definitely worth sampling.;Washington, DC;4;19;583;95;1;3
